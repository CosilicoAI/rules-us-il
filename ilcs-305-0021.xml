                  <p>Low-income households are unable to afford essential utility services and other necessities, such as food, shelter, and medical care; the health and safety of those who are unable to afford essential utility services suffer when monthly payments for these services exceed a reasonable percentage of the customer's household income. Costs of collecting past due bills and uncollectible balances are reflected in rates paid by all ratepayers. Society benefits if essential utility services are affordable and arrearages and disconnections are minimized for those most in need.</p>

                <p>The Department may establish such rules as it deems necessary to implement this Section, including, but not limited to, rules requiring the Department to report the amount of assessments remitted and expended by water or sewer providers and a process to allow a water or sewer provider to discontinue imposing the assessments due to lack of participation or excess in available funds for that water or sewer provider. The process to allow a water or sewer provider to discontinue imposing assessments shall include review by the Commission of any water or sewer provider subject to the Public Utilities Act.</p>

                <p>The charges imposed by this Section shall apply to customers of a water or sewer provider only if the water or sewer provider voluntarily makes an affirmative decision to impose the charge. If a water or sewer provider makes an affirmative decision to impose the charge provided by this Section, the water or sewer provider shall inform the Department of Revenue in writing of such decision when it begins to impose the charge. If a water or sewer provider does not assess this charge, the Department may not use funds from the Water and Sewer Low-Income Assistance Fund to provide benefits to its customers under the Program authorized by Section 15 of this Act. In its use of federal funds under this Act, the Department may not cause a disproportionate share of those federal funds to benefit customers of water or sewer providers that do not assess the Water and Sewer Assistance Charge.</p>
