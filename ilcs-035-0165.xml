                <p>Because Public Act 86-962, effective January 1, 1990, renumbered
Sections
24a-1, 24a-2, 24a-3, 24a-4, and 25.05 of the Counties Code, this Act contains
those provisions as renumbered under Sections 5-1006, 5-1007, 5-1008, 5-1009,
and 5-1024 of the Counties Code.  Because Public Act 86-1475, effective January
10, 1991, resectioned Section 3 of the Use Tax Act, Section 3 of the Service
Use Tax Act, Section 3 of the Service Occupation Tax Act, and Section 2 of the
Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, this Act contains those provisions as
resectioned under Sections 3, 3-5, 3-10, 3-15, 3-20, 3-25, 3-30, 3-35, 3-40,
3-45, 3-50, 3-55, 3-60, 3-65, 3-70,
3-75, and 3-80 of the Use Tax Act; Sections 3, 3-5, 3-10, 3-15, 3-20, 3-25,
3-30, 3-35, 3-40, 3-45, 3-50, 3-55, 3-60, and 3-65 of the Service Use Tax Act;
Sections 3, 3-5, 3-10, 3-15, 3-20, 3-25, 3-30, 3-35, 3-40, 3-45, and 3-50 of
the Service Occupation Tax Act; and Sections 2, 2-5, 2-10, 2-15, 2-20, 2-25,
2-30, 2-35, 2-40, 2-45, 2-50, 2-55, 2-60, 2-65 of the Retailers' Occupation
Tax Act.  Because Public Act 85-1440, effective February 1, 1989, renumbered
Section 6z-16 of the State Finance Act and Section .01 of the State Revenue
Sharing Act, this Act contains those provisions as renumbered under Section
6z-18 of the State Finance Act and Section 0.1 of the State Revenue Sharing
Act.  Sections 10b of the Use Tax Act, 10b of the Service Use Tax Act,
20.1 of the Service Occupation Tax Act, and
6d of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act have been omitted from this Act
because they were repealed by Public Act 87-1258, effective January 7, 1993.</p>

Act; Sections 5.240, 5.241, 6z-9, 6z-17, and 6z-18 of the State Finance Act;
Sections 0.1 and 2 of the State Revenue Sharing Act; and Sections 1 and 2 of
Article V of Public Act 85-1135 as they have been amended.  It also re-repeals
Sections 25.05a, 25.05-2, 25.05-2a, 25.05-3, 25.05-3a, 25.05-10, 25.05-10a, and
25.05-10.1 of "An Act to revise the law in relation to counties" and Sections
10 and 14 of the Service Occupation Tax Act.
This re-enactment and re-repeal is intended to remove any questions as to the
validity or content of those Sections; it is not intended to supersede any
other Public Act that amends the text of a Section as set forth in this Act.
The re-enacted material in this Act is shown as existing text (i.e., without
underscoring) because, as of the time this Act was prepared, the order
declaring P.A. 85-1135 invalid has been vacated.</p>

impose occupation and use taxes, and the corresponding concurrent increase
of the state rate of such taxes with a corresponding distribution to such
municipalities and counties pursuant to this amendatory Act of 1988, shall
remain in full force and effect on a permanent basis; (b) there shall be no reduction or redistribution as to proportional
amount of such corresponding distribution received by such municipalities
and counties except as expressly provided in this amendatory Act of 1988; (c) there shall be no reduction of the rate or base of such taxes
except as expressly provided in this amendatory Act of 1988; (d) there shall be no limitation on the use of monies received by such
municipalities and counties except as expressly provided in this amendatory
Act of 1988; (e) the distribution of occupation tax revenues to municipalities and
counties shall remain on the basis of point of sale; (f) tax revenues collected pursuant to the State use tax Acts on
interstate transactions involving transfer of tangible personal property
shall be distributed in accordance with the formula established by this
amendatory Act of 1988 for State use taxes; and (g) repeal of the statutory authority of municipalities and counties to
impose local retailers' occupation taxes, use taxes, and service occupation
taxes shall not be so construed as to impair the provisions of any
development, redevelopment, annexation, preannexation or other lawful
agreement which describes or refers to receipts from any of such taxes,
but, rather, any such description or reference to such taxes shall be given
effect as if reference were made in such agreement to the replacement
revenue for such abolished taxes received from the Local Government Tax
