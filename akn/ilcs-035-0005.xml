                <p>In general. The business income of a person other than a resident shall be allocated to this State if such person's business income is derived solely from this State. If a person other than a resident derives business income from this State and one or more other states, then, for tax years ending on or before December 30, 1998, and except as otherwise provided by this Section, such person's business income shall be apportioned to this State by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the property factor (if any), the payroll factor (if any) and 200% of the sales factor (if any), and the denominator of which is 4 reduced by the number of factors other than the sales factor which have a denominator of zero and by an additional 2 if the sales factor has a denominator of zero. For tax years ending on or after December 31, 1998, and except as otherwise provided by this Section, persons other than residents who derive business income from this State and one or more other states shall compute their apportionment factor by weighting their property, payroll, and sales factors as provided in subsection</p>

                  <p>Property factor. (A) The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the person's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in the trade or business in this State during the taxable year and the denominator of which is the average value of all the person's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in the trade or business during the taxable year. (B) Property owned by the person is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the person is valued at 8 times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the person less any annual rental rate received by the person from sub-rentals. (C) The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the taxable year, but the Director may require the averaging of monthly values during the taxable year if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the person's property.</p>

                <p>In general. The business income of a person other than a resident shall be allocated to this State if such person's business income is derived solely from this State. If a person other than a resident derives business income from this State and one or more other states, then, for tax years ending on or before December 30, 1998, and except as otherwise provided by this Section, such person's business income shall be apportioned to this State by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the property factor (if any), the payroll factor (if any) and 200% of the sales factor (if any), and the denominator of which is 4 reduced by the number of factors other than the sales factor which have a denominator of zero and by an additional 2 if the sales factor has a denominator of zero. For tax years ending on or after December 31, 1998, and except as otherwise provided by this Section, persons other than residents who derive business income from this State and one or more other states shall compute their apportionment factor by weighting their property, payroll, and sales factors as provided in subsection</p>

                  <p>Property factor. (A) The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the person's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in the trade or business in this State during the taxable year and the denominator of which is the average value of all the person's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in the trade or business during the taxable year. (B) Property owned by the person is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the person is valued at 8 times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the person less any annual rental rate received by the person from sub-rentals. (C) The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the taxable year, but the Director may require the averaging of monthly values during the taxable year if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the person's property.</p>

                <p>Examination of return.  As soon as practicable after a return is
filed, the Department shall examine it to determine the correct amount of
tax. If the Department finds that the amount of tax shown on the return is
less than the correct amount, it shall issue a notice of deficiency to the
taxpayer which shall set forth the amount of tax and penalties proposed to
be assessed. If the Department finds that the tax paid is more than the
correct amount, it shall credit or refund the overpayment as provided by
Section 909. The findings of the Department under this subsection shall
be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness
of the amount of tax and penalties due.</p>

the Department shall consider the claim and, if the taxpayer has so
requested, shall grant the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized
representative a hearing within 6 months after the date such request is filed.

              <p>For the purpose of administering and enforcing the provisions of this
Act, the Department, or any officer or employee of the Department
designated, in writing, by the Director may hold investigations and
hearings concerning any matters covered by this Act that are not otherwise delegated to the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal, and may examine any
books, papers, records or memoranda bearing upon such matters, and may
require the attendance of any person, or any officer or employee of such
person, having knowledge of such matters, and may take testimony and
require proof for its information. In the conduct of any investigation or
hearing, neither the Department nor any officer or employee thereof shall
be bound by the technical rules of evidence, and no informality in any
proceeding, or in the manner of taking testimony, shall invalidate any
order, decision, rule or regulation made or approved or confirmed by the
Department. The Director, or any officer or employee of the Department
authorized by the Director shall have power to administer oaths to such
persons. The books, papers, records and memoranda of the Department, or
parts thereof, may be proved in any hearing, investigation, or legal
proceeding by a reproduced copy thereof
or by a computer print-out of Department records,
under the certificate of the Director.
If reproduced copies of the Department's books, papers, records or
memoranda are offered as proof, the Director must certify that those copies
are true and exact copies of such records on file with the Department.  If
computer print-outs of records of the Department are offered as proof, the
Director must certify that those computer print-outs are true and exact
representations of records properly entered into standard electronic
computing equipment, in the regular course of the Department's business, at
or reasonably near the time of the occurrence of the facts recorded, from
trustworthy and reliable information.
Such reproduced copy shall, without further proof, be admitted
into evidence before the Department or in any legal proceeding.</p>

shall be prosecuted or subjected to any criminal penalty for, or on account

Section, the term &quot;bona fide,&quot; shall not include any mortgage of real or
personal property or any other credit transaction that results in the
mortgagee or the holder of the security acting as trustee for unsecured
creditors of the taxpayer mentioned in the notice of lien who executed such
chattel or real property mortgage or the document evidencing such credit
transaction. Such lien shall be inferior to the lien of general taxes,
special assessments and special taxes heretofore or hereafter levied by any
political subdivision of this State.</p>

Upon payment by the taxpayer to the Department in cash or by guaranteed
remittance of an amount representing the filing fees and charges for the lien
and the filing fees and charges for the release of that lien,
the Department shall release all or any portion of
the property subject to any lien provided for in this Act

that the release will not endanger or jeopardize the collection of the
amount secured thereby.</p>

                <p>Judicial determination. If on judicial review the final judgment

the Department shall release its lien to the extent of such finding of
nonliability, or to the extent of such finding of no jeopardy to the
revenue.
The taxpayer shall, however, be liable for the filing fee imposed by the
Department to file the lien and the filing fee imposed to release 
the lien. The filing fees shall be paid to the Department.</p>

            <content>
              <p>In addition to any other remedy
provided for by the laws of this State, if the tax imposed by this Act
is not paid within the time required by this Act, the Department, or
some person designated by it, may cause a demand to be made on the
taxpayer for the payment thereof.  If such tax remains unpaid for 10
days after such demand has been made and no proceedings have been taken
to review the same, the Department may issue a warrant directed to any
sheriff or other person authorized to serve process, commanding the
sheriff or other person to levy upon the property and rights to property
(whether real or personal, tangible or intangible) of the taxpayer, without
exemption, found within his jurisdiction, for the payment of the amount
thereof with the added penalties, interest and the cost of executing the
warrant. The term &quot;levy&quot; includes the power of distraint and seizure by any
means. In any case in which the warrant to levy has been issued, the
sheriff or other person to whom the warrant was directed may seize and sell
such property or rights to property. Such warrant
shall be returned to the Department together with the money collected by
virtue thereof within the time therein specified, which shall not be
less than 20 nor more than 90 days from the date of the warrant.  The
sheriff or other person to whom such warrant is directed shall proceed in the
same manner as prescribed by law in respect to the enforcement against
property upon judgments by a court, and shall be entitled to the same
fees for his services in executing the warrant, to be collected in the
same manner.  The Department, or some officer, employee or agent
designated by it, is hereby authorized to bid for and purchase any
property sold under the provisions hereof.  No proceedings for a levy
under this Section shall be commenced more than 20 years after the latest
date for filing
of the notice of lien under the provisions of Section 1103, without regard
to whether such notice was actually filed. Any officer or employee of the Department designated in writing by the
Director is authorized to serve process under this Section to levy upon
accounts or other intangible assets of a taxpayer held by a financial
organization, as defined in Section 1501 of this Act.
In addition to any other provisions of this Section, any officer or
employee of the Department designated in writing by the Director may levy
upon the following property and rights to property belonging to a taxpayer:
contractual payments, accounts and notes receivable and other evidences of
debt, and interest on bonds, by serving a notice of levy on the person
making such payment.  Levy shall not be made until the Department has
caused a demand to be made on the taxpayer in the manner provided above.
In addition to any
other provisions
of this Section, any officer or employee of the Department designated in
writing by the Director, may levy upon the salary, wages, commissions and
bonuses of any employee, including
officers,
employees, or elected officials of the United States as authorized by
Section
5520a of the Government Organization and Employees Act (5 U.S.C. 5520a), but
not upon the salary or wages of officers, employees, or elected officials of
any state other than this State, by serving a notice of levy on the employer, as defined in
Section 701(d).  Levy shall not be made until the Department has caused a
demand to be made on the employee in the manner provided above.  The
provisions of Section 12-803 of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to
maximum compensation subject to collection under wage deduction orders shall
apply to all levies made upon compensation
under this Section.
To the extent of the amount due on the levy, the employer or other person
making payments to the taxpayer shall hold any non-exempt wages or other
payments due or which subsequently come due.  The levy or balance due
thereon is a lien on wages or other payments due at the time of the service
of the notice of levy, and such lien shall continue as to subsequent
earnings and other payments until the total amount due upon the levy is
paid, except that such lien on subsequent earnings or other payments shall
terminate sooner if the employment relationship is terminated or if the
notice of levy is rescinded or modified.  The employer or other person making
payments to the taxpayer shall file, on or before the return dates stated
in the notice of levy (which shall not be more often than bimonthly) a
written answer under oath to interrogatories, setting forth the amount due
as wages or other payments to the taxpayer for the payment periods ending
immediately prior to the appropriate return date.  A lien obtained
hereunder shall have priority over any subsequent lien obtained pursuant to
Section 12-808 of the Code of Civil Procedure, except that liens for the
support of a spouse or dependent children shall have priority over all
liens obtained hereunder. In any case where property or rights to property have been seized by an
officer of the Illinois State Police, or successor agency
thereto, under the authority of a warrant to levy issued by the Department
of Revenue, the Department of Revenue may take possession of and may sell
such property or rights to property and the Department of Revenue may
contract with third persons to conduct sales of such property or rights to
the property.  In the conduct of such sales, the Department of Revenue
shall proceed in the same manner as is prescribed by law for proceeding
against property to enforce judgments which are entered by a circuit court
of this State.  If, in the Department of Revenue's opinion, no offer to
purchase at such sale is acceptable and the State's interest would be
better served by retaining the property for sale at a later date, then the
Department may decline to accept any bid and may retain the property for
sale at a later date.</p>
