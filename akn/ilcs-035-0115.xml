Tax Act&quot; or the &quot;Service Use Tax Act&quot;, shall apply to the Department (upon
a form prescribed and furnished by the Department) for a Certificate of
Registration under this Act. Every serviceman maintaining a place of
business in this State, if not required to register under the &quot;Retailers'
Occupation Tax Act&quot;, the &quot;Use Tax Act&quot; or the &quot;Service Use Tax Act&quot;, and
desiring to or required to pay the tax imposed by this Act directly to the
Department, shall, except as provided in Section 10 of this Act, apply to
the Department (upon a form prescribed and furnished by the Department) for
a Certificate of Registration under this Act. In completing such
application, the applicant shall furnish such information as the Department
may reasonably require. Upon approval of an application for Certificate of
Registration, the Department shall issue, without charge, a Certificate of
Registration to the applicant. Such certificate of Registration shall be
displayed at the address which the applicant states in his application to
be the principal place of business or location from which he will act as a
supplier or serviceman in this State. If the applicant will act as a
supplier or serviceman in this State from other places of business or
locations, he shall list the addresses of such additional places of
business or locations in his application for Certificate of Registration,
and the Department shall issue a Sub-Certificate of Registration to the
applicant for each such additional place of business or location. Each
Sub-Certificate of Registration shall be conspicuously displayed at the
place for which it is issued. Such Sub-Certificate of Registration shall
bear the same registration number as that appearing upon the Certificate of
Registration to which such Sub-Certificate relates. Where a supplier or
serviceman operates more than one place of business which is subject to
registration under this Section and such businesses are substantially
different in character or are engaged in under different trade names or are
engaged in under other substantially dissimilar circumstances (so that it
is more practicable, from an accounting, auditing or bookkeeping
standpoint, for such businesses to be separately registered), the
Department may require or permit such person to apply for and obtain a
separate Certificate of Registration for each such business or for any of
such businesses instead of registering such person, as to all such
businesses, under a single Certificate of Registration supplemented by
related Sub-Certificates of Registration. Such Certificate of Registration
shall not be issued to any person who is in default to the State of
Illinois for moneys due under this Act. The Department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the
collection of the tax herein imposed by any supplier or serviceman not
maintaining a place of business within this State, who, to the satisfaction
of the Department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and
payment of the tax. Such supplier or serviceman shall be issued, without
charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the
duty of such supplier or serviceman to collect the tax upon all tangible
personal property sold to his knowledge for the purpose of resale as an
incident to the sale of a service within this State, in the same manner and
subject to the same requirements including the furnishing of a receipt to
the serviceman (if demanded by the serviceman), as a supplier or serviceman
maintaining a place of business within this State. The receipt given to the
serviceman shall be sufficient to relieve him from further liability for
the tax to which such receipt may refer. Such permit may be revoked by the
Department as provided in this Act.</p>

Registration under this Act has been revoked in accordance with Section 12
of this Act, is guilty of a Class 4 felony. Each day any such person
is engaged in business in violation of Section 6, or after his Certificate of
Registration under this Act has been revoked, constitutes a separate offense. When the amount due is under $300, any person who accepts money that
is due to the Department under this Act from a taxpayer for the purpose of
acting as the taxpayer's agent to make the payment to the Department, but
who fails to remit such payment to the Department when due is guilty of a
Class 4 felony. Any such person who purports to make such payment by
issuing or delivering a check or other order upon a real or fictitious
depository for the payment of money, knowing that it will not be paid by
the depository, shall be guilty of a deceptive practice in violation of
Section 17-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. When the amount due is $300 or more, any person subject to the
provisions hereof who fails to file a return, or who violates any other
provision of Section 9 or Section 10 hereof, or who fails to keep books and
records as required herein, or who files a fraudulent return, or who

a seller that such purchaser has a registration number or a resale number
from the Department when he knows that he does not, or who uses his
registration number or resale number to make a seller believe that he is
buying tangible personal property for resale when such purchaser in fact
knows that this is not the case, is guilty of a Class 3 felony. When the amount due is $300 or more, any person who accepts money that is
due to the Department under this Act from a taxpayer for the purpose of
acting as the taxpayer's agent to make the payment to the
Department but who fails to remit such payment to the Department when due
is guilty of a Class 3 felony.  Any such person who purports to make such
payment by issuing or delivering a check or other order upon a real or
fictitious depository for the payment of money, knowing that it will not be
paid by the depository shall be guilty of a deceptive practice in violation
of Section 17-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. Any serviceman who collects or attempts to collect Service Occupation Tax,
measured by receipts which such serviceman knows are not subject to Service
Occupation Tax, or any serviceman who collects or attempts to collect an
amount (however designated) which purports to reimburse such serviceman for
Service Occupation Tax liability measured by receipts or selling prices which
such serviceman knows are not subject to Service Occupation Tax, or any
serviceman who knowingly over-collects or attempts to
over-collect Service Occupation Tax or an amount purporting to be
reimbursement for Service Occupation Tax liability in a transaction which
is subject to the tax that is imposed by this Act, shall be guilty of a
Class 4 felony for each such offense. This paragraph does not apply to an
amount collected by the serviceman as reimbursement for the serviceman's
Service Occupation Tax liability on receipts or selling prices which are
subject to tax under this Act, as long as such collection is made in
compliance with the tax collection brackets prescribed by the Department in
its Rules and Regulations. Any person who knowingly sells, purchases, installs, transfers, possesses, uses, or accesses any automated sales suppression device, zapper, or phantom-ware in this State is guilty of a Class 3 felony. For the purposes of this Section: &quot;Automated sales suppression device&quot; or &quot;zapper&quot; means a software program that falsifies the electronic records of an electronic cash register or other point-of-sale system, including, but not limited to, transaction data and transaction reports.  The term includes the software program, any device that carries the software program, or an Internet link to the software program. &quot;Phantom-ware&quot; means a hidden programming option embedded in the operating system of an electronic cash register or hardwired into an electronic cash register that can be used to create a second set of records or that can eliminate or manipulate transaction records in an electronic cash register. &quot;Electronic cash register&quot; means a device that keeps a register or supporting documents through the use of an electronic device or computer system designed to record transaction data for the purpose of computing, compiling, or processing retail sales transaction data in any manner. &quot;Transaction data&quot; includes: items purchased by a customer; the price of each item; a taxability determination for each item; a segregated tax amount for each taxed item; the amount of cash or credit tendered; the net amount returned to the customer in change; the date and time of the purchase; the name, address, and identification number of the vendor; and the receipt or invoice number of the transaction. &quot;Transaction report&quot; means a report that documents, without limitation, the sales, taxes, or fees collected, media totals, and discount voids at an electronic cash register and that is printed on a cash register tape at the end of a day or shift, or a report that documents every action at an electronic cash register and is stored electronically. A prosecution for any act in violation of this Section may be commenced
at any time within 3 years of the commission of that act. This Section does not apply if the violation in a particular case also
constitutes a criminal violation of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act or
the Use Tax Act.</p>

            <heading>If it shall appear that an amount of tax or penalty or interest has
been paid in error hereunder directly to the Department by a serviceman,
whether such amount be paid through a mistake of fact or an error of law, such
serviceman may file a claim for credit or refund with the Department</heading>
            <content>
              <p>If it
shall appear that an amount of tax or penalty or interest has been paid in
error to the Department hereunder by a supplier who is required or
authorized to collect and remit the Service Occupation Tax, whether such
amount be paid through a mistake of fact or an error of law, such supplier
may file a claim for credit or refund with the Department, provided that no
credit shall be allowed nor any refund made for any amount paid by any such
supplier unless it shall appear that he bore the burden of such amount and
did not shift the burden thereof to anyone else (as in the case of a
duplicated tax payment which the supplier made to the Department and did
not collect from anyone else), or unless it shall appear that he or his
legal representative has unconditionally repaid such amount to his vendee
(1) who bore the burden thereof and has not shifted such burden directly or
indirectly in any manner whatsoever; (2) who, if he has shifted such
burden, has repaid unconditionally such amount to his own vendee, and (3)
who is not entitled to receive any reimbursement therefor from any other
source than from his supplier, nor to be relieved of such burden in any
other manner whatsoever. Any credit or refund that is allowed under this Section shall bear interest
at the rate and in the manner specified in the Uniform Penalty and Interest
Act. Any claim filed hereunder shall be filed upon a form prescribed and
furnished by the Department. The claim shall be signed by the claimant (or
by the claimant's legal representative if the claimant shall have died or
become a person under legal disability), or by a duly
authorized agent of the claimant or his or her legal representative. A claim for credit or refund shall be considered to have been filed with
the Department on the date upon which it is received by the Department.
Upon receipt of any claim for credit or refund filed under this Act, any
officer or employee of the Department, authorized in writing by the
Director of Revenue to acknowledge receipt of such claims on behalf of the
Department, shall execute on behalf of the Department, and shall deliver or
mail to the claimant or his or her duly authorized agent, a written receipt,
acknowledging that the claim has been filed with the Department, describing
the claim in sufficient detail to identify it and stating the date upon
which the claim was received by the Department. Such written receipt shall
be prima facie evidence that the Department received the claim described in
such receipt and shall be prima facie evidence of the date when such claim
was received by the Department. In the absence of such a written receipt,
the records of the Department as to when the claim was received by the
Department, or as to whether or not the claim was received at all by the
Department, shall be deemed to be prima facie correct upon these questions
in the event of any dispute between the claimant (or his legal
representative) and the Department concerning these questions. In case the Department determines that the claimant is entitled to a
refund, such refund shall be made only from the Aviation Fuel Sales Tax Refund Fund or from such appropriation as may be
available for that purpose, as appropriate. If it appears unlikely that the amount available
 would permit everyone having a claim allowed during the period
covered by such appropriation or from the Aviation Fuel Sales Tax Refund Fund, as appropriate, to elect to receive a cash refund, the
Department, by rule or regulation, shall provide for the payment of refunds in
hardship cases and shall define what types of cases qualify as hardship cases.</p>

            <heading>As soon as practicable after a claim for credit or refund is filed, the
Department shall examine the same and determine the amount of credit or
refund to which the claimant or the claimant's legal representative, in the
event that the claimant shall have died or become a person under legal disability,
is entitled
and shall, by its Notice of Tentative Determination of Claim, notify the
claimant or his or her legal representative of such determination, which
determination shall be prima facie correct</heading>
            <content>
              <p>Proof of such determination by
the Department may be made at any hearing before the Department or the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal, as applicable, or in any
legal proceeding by a reproduced copy of the Department's record relating
thereto, in the name of the Department under the certificate of the
Director of Revenue. Such reproduced copy shall, without further proof, be
admitted into evidence before the Department or in any legal proceeding and
shall be prima facie proof of the correctness of the Department's
determination, as shown therein. If such claimant, or the legal
representative of a deceased claimant or a claimant
who is under legal disability shall, within 60 days
after the Department's Notice of Tentative Determination of Claim, file a
protest thereto and request a hearing thereon, the Department shall give
notice to such claimant, or the legal representative of a deceased claimant
or a claimant who is under legal disability,
of the time and place fixed for such hearing, and
shall hold a hearing in conformity with the provisions of this Act, and
pursuant thereto shall issue its Final Determination of the amount, if any,
found to be due as a result of such hearing, to such claimant, or the legal
representative of a deceased claimant or a claimant
who is under legal disability. If a protest to the Department's Notice of Tentative Determination of
Claim is not filed within 60 days and a request for a hearing
thereon is
not made as provided herein, the Notice shall thereupon become and
operate as a Final Determination; and, if the Department's Notice of
Tentative Determination, upon becoming a Final Determination, indicates no
amount due to the claimant, or, upon issuance of a credit or refund for the
amount, if any, found by the Department to be due, the claim in all its
aspects shall be closed and no longer open to protest, hearing, judicial
review, or by any other proceeding or action whatever, either before the
Department or in any court of this State. Claims for credit or refund
hereunder must be filed with and initially determined by the Department,
the remedy herein provided being exclusive; and no court shall have
jurisdiction to determine the merits of any claim except upon review as
provided in this Act.</p>

No
claim shall be allowed for any amount paid to the Department, whether paid
voluntarily or involuntarily, if paid in total or partial liquidation of an
assessment which had become final before the claim for credit or refund to
recover the amount so paid is filed with the Department, or if paid in
total or partial liquidation of a judgment or order of court.</p>

            <content>
              <p>For this purpose, if proceedings are pending to determine whether or not any tax or penalty or interest is due hereunder, or under the Service Use Tax Act, the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, the Use Tax Act, or any local occupation or use tax administered by the Department, from such person, the Department may withhold issuance of the credit or refund pending the final disposition of such proceedings and may apply such credit or refund against any amount found to be due to the Department as a result of such proceedings. The balance, if any, of the credit or refund shall be issued to the person entitled thereto. Any credit memorandum issued hereunder may be used by the authorized holder thereof to pay any tax or penalty or interest due or to become due under this Act, or under the Service Use Tax Act, the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, the Use Tax Act, or any local occupation or use tax administered by the Department, from such holder. Subject to reasonable rules of the Department, a credit memorandum issued hereunder may be assigned by the holder thereof to any other person for use in paying tax or penalty or interest which may be due or become due under this Act, the Service Use Tax Act, the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, the Use Tax Act, or any local occupation or use tax administered by the Department, from the assignee. In any case in which there has been an erroneous refund of tax payable under this Act, a notice of tax liability may be issued at any time within 3 years from the making of that refund, or within 5 years from the making of that refund if it appears that any part of the refund was induced by fraud or the misrepresentation of a material fact. The amount of any proposed assessment set forth in the notice shall be limited to the amount of the erroneous refund.</p>
