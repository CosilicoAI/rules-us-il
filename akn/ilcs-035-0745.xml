Failure to pay all taxes due to the State for a taxable period shall invalidate any amnesty granted under this Act. Amnesty shall be granted only if all amnesty conditions are satisfied by the taxpayer. Amnesty shall not be granted to taxpayers who are a party to any criminal investigation or to any civil or criminal litigation that is pending in any circuit court or appellate court or the Supreme Court of this State for nonpayment, delinquency, or fraud in relation to any State tax imposed by any law of the State of Illinois. Participation in an amnesty program shall not preclude a taxpayer from claiming a refund for an overpayment of tax on an issue unrelated to the issues for which the taxpayer claimed amnesty or for an overpayment of tax by taxpayers estimating a non-final liability for the amnesty program pursuant to Section 506</p>
