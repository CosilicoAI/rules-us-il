            <heading>Beginning on July 1, 2019, in place of the aggregate tax rate of 99 mills previously imposed by this Act, a tax is imposed upon the privilege of using cigarettes in this State at the rate of 149 mills per cigarette so used</heading>
            <content>
              <p>The tax herein imposed shall be in
addition to
all other occupation or privilege taxes imposed by the State of Illinois or by
any political subdivision thereof or by any municipal corporation. If the tax imposed herein terminates or has terminated, distributors
who have bought stamps while such tax was in effect and who therefore paid
such tax, but who can show, to the Department's satisfaction, that they
sold the cigarettes to which they affixed such stamps after such tax had
terminated and did not recover the tax or its equivalent from purchasers,
shall be allowed by the Department to take credit for such absorbed tax
against subsequent tax stamp purchases from the Department by such
distributors. When the word &quot;tax&quot; is used in this Act, it shall include any tax or tax
rate imposed by this Act and shall mean the singular of &quot;tax&quot; or the plural
&quot;taxes&quot; as the context may require. Any retailer having cigarettes in its possession on July 1, 2019 to which tax stamps have been affixed is not required to pay the additional tax that begins on July 1, 2019 imposed by this amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly on those stamped cigarettes. Any distributor having cigarettes in his or her possession on July 1, 2019 to which tax stamps have been affixed, and any distributor having stamps in his or her possession on July 1, 2019 that have not been affixed to packages of cigarettes before July 1, 2019, is required to pay the additional tax that begins on July 1, 2019 imposed by this amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly to the extent that the volume of affixed and unaffixed stamps in the distributor's possession  on July 1, 2019 exceeds the average monthly volume of cigarette stamps purchased by the distributor in calendar year 2018. This payment, less the discount provided in Section 3, is due when the distributor first makes a purchase of cigarette stamps on or after July 1, 2019 or on the first due date of a return under this Act occurring on or after July 1, 2019, whichever occurs first. Those distributors may elect to pay the additional tax on packages of cigarettes to which stamps have been affixed and on any stamps in the distributor's possession that have not been affixed to packages of cigarettes in their possession on July 1, 2019 over a period not to exceed 12 months from the due date of the additional tax by notifying the Department in writing. The first payment for distributors making such election is due when the distributor first makes a purchase of cigarette tax stamps on or after July 1, 2019 or on the first due date of a return under this Act occurring on or after July 1, 2019, whichever occurs first. Distributors making such an election are not entitled to take the discount provided in Section 3 on such payments.</p>

            <content>
              <p>The tax hereby imposed shall be collected by a
distributor
maintaining a place of business in this State or a distributor authorized
by the Department pursuant to Section 7 hereof to collect the tax, and the
amount of the tax shall be added to the price of the cigarettes sold by
such distributor. Collection of the tax shall be evidenced by a stamp or
stamps affixed to each original package of cigarettes or by an authorized
substitute for such stamp imprinted on each original package of such
cigarettes underneath the sealed transparent outside wrapper of such
original package, except as hereinafter provided. Each distributor who is
required or authorized to collect the tax herein imposed, before delivering
or causing to be delivered any original packages of cigarettes in this
State to any purchaser, shall firmly affix a proper stamp or stamps to each
such package, or (in the case of manufacturers of cigarettes in original
packages which are contained inside a sealed transparent wrapper) shall
imprint the required language on the original package of cigarettes beneath
such outside wrapper as hereinafter provided. Such stamp or stamps need not
be affixed to the original package of any cigarettes with respect to which
the distributor is required to affix a like stamp or stamps by virtue of
the Cigarette Tax Act, however, and no tax imprint need be placed
underneath the sealed transparent wrapper of an original package of
cigarettes with respect to which the distributor is required or authorized
to employ a like tax imprint by virtue of the Cigarette Tax Act. Any distributor who purchases stamps may credit any excess payments verified by the Department against amounts subsequently due for the purchase of additional stamps, until such time as no excess payment remains. No stamp or imprint may be affixed to, or made upon, any package of
cigarettes unless that package complies with all requirements of the federal
Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 U.S.C. 1331 and following, for the
placement of labels, warnings, or any other information upon a package of
cigarettes that is sold within the United States.  Under the authority of
Section 6, the Department shall revoke the license of any distributor that is
determined to have violated this paragraph.
 A person may not affix a stamp on a package of cigarettes, cigarette papers,
wrappers, or tubes if that individual package has been marked for export
outside the United States with a label or notice in compliance with Section
290.185 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  It is not a defense to
a proceeding for violation of this paragraph that the label or notice has been
removed, mutilated, obliterated, or altered in any manner. Only distributors licensed under this Act and transporters, as defined in Section 9c of the Cigarette Tax Act, may possess unstamped original packages of cigarettes.  Prior to shipment to an Illinois retailer or secondary distributor, a stamp shall be applied to each original package of cigarettes sold to the retailer or secondary distributor.  A distributor may apply a tax stamp only to an original package of cigarettes purchased or obtained directly from an in-state maker, manufacturer, or fabricator licensed as a distributor under Section 4 of this Act or an out-of-state maker, manufacturer, or fabricator holding a permit under Section 7 of this Act.  A licensed distributor may ship or otherwise cause to be delivered unstamped original packages of cigarettes in, into, or from this State. A licensed distributor may transport unstamped original packages of cigarettes to a facility, wherever located, owned or controlled by such distributor; however, a distributor may not transport unstamped original packages of cigarettes to a facility where retail sales of cigarettes take place or to a facility where a secondary distributor makes sales for resale. Any licensed distributor that ships or otherwise causes to be delivered unstamped original packages of cigarettes into, within, or from this State shall ensure that the invoice or equivalent documentation and the bill of lading or freight bill for the shipment identifies the true name and address of the consignor or seller, the true name and address of the consignee or purchaser, and the quantity by brand style of the cigarettes so transported, provided that this Section shall not be construed as to impose any requirement or liability upon any common or contract carrier. Distributors making sales of cigarettes to secondary distributors shall add the amount of the tax to the price of the cigarettes sold by the distributors. Secondary distributors making sales of cigarettes to retailers shall include the amount of the tax in the price of the cigarettes sold to retailers.  The amount of tax shall not be less than the amount of taxes imposed by the State and all local jurisdictions. The amount of local taxes shall be calculated based on the location of the retailer's place of business shown on the retailer's certificate of registration or sub-registration issued to the retailer pursuant to Section 2a of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act.  The original packages of cigarettes sold by the retailer shall bear all the required stamps, or other indicia, for the taxes included in the price of cigarettes. Stamps, when required hereunder, shall be purchased from the Department, or
any person authorized by the Department, by distributors.  On and after July
1, 2003, payment for such stamps must be made by means of
electronic funds transfer.  The Department may
refuse to sell stamps to any person who does not comply with the provisions
of this Act.  Beginning on June 6, 2002 and through June 30, 2002,
persons holding valid licenses as distributors may purchase cigarette tax
stamps up to an amount equal to 115% of the distributor's average monthly
cigarette tax stamp purchases over the 12 calendar months prior to June
6, 2002. Prior to December 1, 1985, the Department shall
allow a distributor
21 days in which to make final
payment of the amount to be paid for such stamps, by allowing the
distributor to make payment for the stamps at the time of purchasing them
with a draft which shall be in such form as the Department prescribes, and
which shall be payable within 21 days thereafter: Provided that such
distributor has filed with the Department, and has received the
Department's approval of, a bond, which is in addition to the bond required
under Section 4 of this Act, payable to the Department in an amount equal
to 80% of such distributor's average monthly tax liability to
the Department under this Act during the preceding calendar year or
$500,000, whichever is less. The bond shall be joint and
several and shall be in the form of a surety company bond in such form as
the Department prescribes, or it may be in the form of a bank certificate
of deposit or bank letter of credit. The bond shall be conditioned upon the
distributor's payment of the amount of any 21-day draft which the
Department accepts from that distributor for the delivery of stamps to that
distributor under this Act. The distributor's failure to pay any such
draft, when due, shall also make such distributor automatically liable to
the Department for a penalty equal to 25% of the amount of such draft. On and after December 1, 1985 and until July 1, 2003, the Department
shall allow a distributor
30 days in which to make
final payment of the amount to be paid for such stamps, by allowing the
distributor to make payment for the stamps at the time of purchasing them
with a draft which shall be in such form as the Department prescribes, and
which shall be payable within 30 days thereafter, and beginning on January 1,
2003 and thereafter, the draft shall be payable by means of electronic funds
transfer:  Provided that such
distributor has filed with the Department, and has received the
Department's approval of, </p>

            <content>
              <p>No person may engage in business as a secondary distributor of cigarettes in this State without first having obtained a license therefor from the Department.  A secondary distributor maintaining a place of business within this State, if required to procure a license as a secondary distributor under the Cigarette Tax Act, need not obtain an additional license or permit under this Act, but shall be deemed to be sufficiently licensed or registered by virtue of his being licensed or registered under the Cigarette Tax Act. Every secondary distributor maintaining a place of business in this State, if not required to procure a license under the Cigarette Tax Act, shall make application for a license on a form as furnished and prescribed by the Department.  Such applicant shall furnish the following information to the Department on a form signed and verified by the applicant under penalty of perjury: (1) the name and address of the applicant; (2) the address of the location at which the applicant proposes to engage in business as a secondary distributor of cigarettes in this State; and (3) such other additional information as the Department may reasonably require. The annual license fee payable to the Department for each secondary distributor's license shall be $250. The applicant for license shall pay such fee to the Department at the time of submitting the application for license to the Department. A separate application for license shall be made and a separate annual license fee paid, for each place of business at or from which the applicant proposes to act as a secondary distributor under this Act and for which the applicant is not required to procure a license as a secondary distributor under the Cigarette Tax Act. The following are ineligible to receive a secondary distributor's license under this Act: (1) a person who is not of good character and reputation in the community in which he resides; (2) a person who has been convicted of a felony under any Federal or State law, if the Department, after investigation and a hearing, if requested by the applicant, determines that such person has not been sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant the public trust; (3) a corporation, if any officer, manager or director thereof, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate more than 5% of the stock of such corporation, would not be eligible to receive a license hereunder for any reason; (4) a person who manufactures cigarettes, whether in this State or out of this State; (5) a person, or any person who owns more than 15 percent of the ownership interests in a person or a related party who: (A) owes, at the time of application, any delinquent cigarette taxes that have been determined by law to be due and unpaid, unless the license applicant has entered into an agreement approved by the Department to pay the amount due; (B) had a license under this Act or the Cigarette Tax Act revoked within the past 2 years by the Department for misconduct relating to stolen or contraband cigarettes or has been convicted of a State or federal crime, punishable by imprisonment of one year or more, relating to stolen or contraband cigarettes; (C) has been found by the Department, after notice and a hearing, to have imported or caused to be imported into the United States for sale or distribution any cigarette in violation of 19 U.S.C. 1681a; (D) has been found by the Department, after notice and a hearing, to have imported or caused to be imported into the United States for sale or distribution or manufactured for sale or distribution in the United States any cigarette that does not fully comply with the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (15 U.S.C. 1331, et seq.); or (E) has been found by the Department, after notice and a hearing, to have made a material false statement in the application or has failed to produce records required to be maintained by this Act. Upon approval of such application and payment of the required annual license fee, the Department shall issue a license to the applicant. Such license shall permit the applicant to engage in business as a secondary distributor at or from the place shown in his application. All licenses issued by the Department under this Act shall be valid for not to exceed one year after issuance unless sooner revoked, canceled or suspended as in this Act provided. No license issued under this Act is transferable or assignable. Such license shall be conspicuously displayed at the place of business for which it is issued. No secondary distributor licensee acquires any vested interest or compensable property right in a license issued under this Act. A licensed secondary distributor shall notify the Department of any change in the information contained on the application form, including any change in ownership, and shall do so within 30 days after any such change. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Department under this Section may, within 20 days after notice of the decision, protest and request a hearing. Upon receiving a request for a hearing, the Department shall give notice to the person requesting the hearing of the time and place fixed for the hearing and shall hold a hearing in conformity with the provisions of this Act and then issue its final administrative decision in the matter to that person. In the absence of a protest and request for a hearing within 20 days, the Department's decision shall become final without any further determination being made or notice given.</p>

Secondary distributors may sell cigarettes to Illinois retailers who are licensed under Section 4g of the Cigarette Tax Act for resale, and are also authorized to make retail sales of cigarettes at the location on the secondary distributor's license as long as the secondary distributor obtains a license under Section 4g of the Cigarette Tax Act and sells 75% or more of the cigarettes sold at such location to retailers who are licensed under Section 4g of the Cigarette Tax Act for resale. All sales by secondary distributors to Illinois retailers who are licensed under Section 4g of the Cigarette Tax Act must be made at the location on the secondary distributor's license. Retailers who are issued a license under Section 4g of the Cigarette Tax Act must take possession of all cigarettes sold by the secondary distributor at the secondary distributor's licensed address. Secondary distributors may not make deliveries of cigarettes to Illinois retailers who are licensed under Section 4g of the Cigarette Tax Act. Secondary distributors may not file a claim for credit or refund with the State under Section 14a of this Act.</p>

Any distributor or secondary distributor aggrieved by any decision of the Department under this Section may, within 20 days after notice of the decision, protest and request a hearing. Upon receiving a request for a hearing, the Department shall give notice in writing to the distributor or secondary distributor requesting the hearing that contains a statement of the charges preferred against the distributor or secondary distributor and that states the time and place fixed for the hearing. The Department shall hold the hearing in conformity with the provisions of this Act and then issue its final administrative decision in the matter to the distributor or secondary distributor.

No license so revoked, shall be reissued to any such distributor or secondary distributor within a period of 6 months after the date of the final determination of such revocation. No such license shall be reissued at all so long as the person who would receive the license is ineligible to receive a distributor's license under this Act for any one or more of the reasons provided for in Section 4 of this Act or is ineligible to receive a secondary distributor's license under this Act for any one or more of the reasons provided for in Section 4b and Section 7a of this Act.

filed, the Department shall issue the person filing such return a notice of
tax liability for the amount of tax claimed by the Department to be due,

claimed by the Department to be due for a given period, but without any
obligation upon the Department to allocate such deficiency to any

determined in accordance with Sections 3-3, 3-5 and 3-6 of the Uniform
Penalty and Interest Act, under which circumstances the aforesaid notice of
tax liability shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie
evidence of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown therein; and
proof of such correctness may be made in accordance with, and the
admissibility of a reproduced copy of such notice of tax liability shall be
governed by, all the provisions of this Act applicable to corrected returns. If any person filing any return dies or becomes a person under legal
disability at any time before the Department issues its notice of tax
liability, such notice shall be issued to the administrator, executor or
other legal representative, as such, of such person. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, if within 60 days after such notice of tax liability, the person
to whom
such notice is issued or his legal representative files a protest to such
notice of tax liability and requests a hearing thereon, the Department
shall give notice to such person or legal representative of the time and
place fixed for such hearing, and shall hold a hearing in conformity with
the provisions of this Act, and pursuant thereto shall issue a final
assessment to such person or legal representative for the amount found to
be due as a result of such hearing. Effective July 1, 2013, protests concerning matters that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal shall be filed with the Tribunal in accordance with the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal Act of 2012, and hearings concerning those matters shall be held before the Tribunal in accordance with that Act.  With respect to protests filed with the Department prior to July 1, 2013 that would otherwise be subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal, the person filing the protest may elect to be subject to the provisions of the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal Act of 2012 at any time on or after July 1, 2013, but not later than 30 days after the date on which the protest was filed.  If made, the election shall be irrevocable. If a protest to the notice of tax
liability and a request for a hearing thereon is not filed within the time allowed by law, such notice of tax liability shall
become final without the necessity of a final assessment being issued and
shall be deemed to be a final assessment. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, any amount paid as tax or in respect of tax paid under this Act shall be deemed assessed upon the date of receipt of payment.</p>

              <p>In case any person who is required to
file a return under this
Act fails to file such return, the Department shall determine the amount of
tax due from him according to its best judgment and information, which
amount so fixed by the Department shall be prima facie correct and shall be
prima facie evidence of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown
in such determination. Proof of such determination by the Department may be
made at any hearing before the Department or in any legal proceeding by a
reproduced copy of the Department's record relating thereto in the name of
the Department under the certificate of the Director of Revenue. Such
reproduced copy shall, without further proof, be admitted into evidence
before the Department or in any legal proceeding and shall be prima facie
proof of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown therein. The
Department shall issue such person a notice of tax liability for the amount
of tax claimed by the Department to be due, together with a penalty in
an amount determined in accordance with Sections 3-3, 3-5 and 3-6 of the
Uniform Penalty and Interest Act. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, if such person or the legal representative of
such person, within 60 days after such notice, files a protest to
such
notice of tax liability and requests a hearing thereon, the Department
shall give notice to such person or the legal representative of such person

            <heading>In case of failure to pay the tax, or any portion thereof, or any
penalty provided for in this Act, when due, the Department may bring an
action to recover the amount of such tax, or portion thereof, or penalty;
or, if the taxpayer shall have died or shall have become a person under legal
disability, by filing claim therefor against his or her estate; provided
that no such action with respect to any tax, or portion thereof, or
penalty, shall be instituted more than 2 years after the cause of action
accrues, except with the consent of the person from whom such tax or penalty
is due</heading>
            <content>
              <p>After the expiration of the period within which the person assessed may
file an action for judicial review under the Administrative Review Law without
such an action being filed, a certified copy of the final assessment or
revised final assessment of the Department may be filed with the Circuit
Court of the county in which the taxpayer has his or her principal place of
business, or of Sangamon County in those cases in which the taxpayer does
not have his or her principal place of business in this State. The certified
copy of the final assessment or revised final assessment shall be accompanied
by a certification which recites facts that are sufficient to show that the
Department complied with the jurisdictional requirements of the Act in
arriving at its final assessment or its revised final assessment and that
the taxpayer had his  opportunity for an administrative hearing and for
judicial review, whether he  availed himself or herself of either or both
of these opportunities or not. If the court is satisfied that the Department
complied with the jurisdictional requirements of the Act in arriving at its
final assessment or its revised final assessment and that the taxpayer had
his or her opportunity for an administrative hearing and for judicial review,
whether he  availed himself or herself of either or both of these opportunities
or not, the court shall enter judgment in favor of the Department and against
the taxpayer for the amount shown to be due by the final assessment or the
revised final assessment, and such judgment shall be entered of record in
the court. Such judgment shall bear the rate of interest set in the Uniform
Penalty and Interest Act, but otherwise shall have the same effect as other
judgments.  The judgment shall be enforceable, and all laws applicable to
sales for the enforcement of a judgment shall be applicable to sales made
under such judgments. The Department shall file the certified copy of its
assessment, as herein provided, with the Circuit Court within 2 years after
such assessment becomes final except when the taxpayer consents in writing
to an extension of such filing period. If, when the cause of action for a proceeding in court accrues against a
person, he or she is out of the State, the action may be commenced within the
times herein limited, after his or her coming into or return to the State;
and if, after the cause of action accrues, he or she departs from and
remains out of the State, the time of his or her absence is no part of the
time limited for the commencement of the action; but the foregoing
provisions concerning absence from the State shall not apply to any case in
which, at the time the cause of action accrues, the party against whom the
cause of action accrues is not a resident of this State. The time within
which a court action is to be commenced by the Department hereunder shall
not run while the taxpayer is a debtor in any proceeding under the Federal
Bankruptcy Act nor thereafter until 90 days after the Department is
notified by such debtor of being discharged in bankruptcy. No claim shall be filed against the estate of any deceased person or
person under legal disability for any tax or penalty or part of either
except in the manner prescribed and within the time limited by the Probate
Act of 1975, as amended. The remedies provided for herein shall not be exclusive, but all
remedies available to creditors for the collection of debts shall be
available for the collection of any tax or penalty due hereunder. The collection of such tax or penalty shall not be a bar to any
prosecution under this Act. The certificate of the Director of the Department to the effect that a
tax or amount required to be paid by this Act has not been paid, that a
return has not been filed, or that information has not been supplied
pursuant to the provisions of this Act, shall be prima facie evidence
thereof. All of the provisions of Sections 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f, 5g, 5i and
5j of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act which are not inconsistent
with this Act, and Section 3-7 of the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act,
shall apply, as far as practicable, to the subject matter of
this Act to the same extent as if such provisions were included herein.
References in such incorporated Sections of the &quot;Retailers' Occupation Tax
Act&quot; to retailers, to sellers or to persons engaged in the business of

            <heading>If it appears, after claim therefor filed with the Department, that an
amount of tax or penalty has been paid which was not due under this Act,
whether as the result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, except as
hereinafter provided, then the Department shall issue a credit memorandum
or refund to the person who made the erroneous payment or, if that person
has died or become a person under legal disability,
to his or her legal representative, as such</heading>
            <content>
              <p>If it is determined that the Department should issue a credit or refund
under this Act, the Department may first apply the amount thereof against
any amount of tax or penalty due under this Act or under the Cigarette Tax
Act from the person entitled to such credit or refund. For this purpose, if
proceedings are pending to determine whether or not any tax or penalty is
due under this Act or under the Cigarette Tax Act from such person, the
Department may withhold issuance of the credit or refund pending the final
disposition of such proceedings and may apply such credit or refund against
any amount found to be due to the Department under this Act or under the
Cigarette Tax Act as a result of such proceedings. The balance, if any, of
the credit or refund shall be issued to the person entitled thereto. If no tax or penalty is due and no proceeding is pending to determine
whether such taxpayer is indebted to the Department for tax or penalty, the
credit memorandum or refund shall be issued to the claimant; or (in the
case of a credit memorandum) may be assigned and set over by the lawful
holder thereof, subject to reasonable rules of the Department, to any other
person who is subject to this Act or the Cigarette Tax Act, and the amount
thereof shall be applied by the Department against any tax or penalty due
or to become due under this Act or under the Cigarette Tax Act from such
assignee. As to any claim filed hereunder with the Department on and after each
January 1 and July 1, no amount of tax or penalty erroneously paid (either
in total or partial liquidation of a tax or penalty under this Act) more
than 3 years prior to such January 1 and July 1, respectively, shall be
credited or refunded, except that if both the Department and the taxpayer
have agreed to an
extension of time to issue a notice of tax liability under this Act, the claim
may be filed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act to the contrary, for any period included in a claim for credit or refund for which the statute of limitations for issuing a notice of tax liability under this Act will expire less than 6 months after the date a taxpayer files the claim for credit or refund, the statute of limitations is automatically extended for 6 months from the date it would have otherwise expired. In case the Department determines that the claimant is entitled to a
refund, such refund shall be made only from such appropriation as may be
available for that purpose. If it appears unlikely that the amount
appropriated would permit everyone having a claim allowed during the period
covered by such appropriation to elect to receive a cash refund, the
Department, by rule or regulation, shall provide for the payment of refunds
in hardship cases and shall define what types of cases qualify as hardship
cases. If the Department approves a claim for the physical replacement of
cigarette tax stamps, the Department (subject to the same limitations as
those provided for hereinbefore in this Section) may issue an assignable
credit memorandum or refund to the claimant or to the claimant's legal
representative. Any credit or refund that is allowed under this Act shall bear interest at
the rate and in the manner set forth in the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act. The provisions of Sections 6a, 6b and 6c of the &quot;Retailers' Occupation
Tax Act&quot;, approved June 28, 1933, as amended, in effect on the effective
date of this amendatory Act, as subsequently amended, which are not
inconsistent with this Act, shall apply, as far as practicable, to the
subject matter of this Act to the same extent as if such provisions were
included herein.</p>

to the United States Government or the government of any other state, or
any officer or agency thereof, for exclusively official purposes,
information received by the Department in administering this Act,
provided that such other governmental agency agrees to divulge requested
tax information to the Department. The furnishing upon request of the Auditor General, or his authorized

of this Section. The furnishing of financial information to a home rule unit with a
population in excess of 2,000,000 that has
imposed a tax similar to that imposed by this Act under its home rule powers,
upon request of the Chief Executive of the home rule unit, is an official
purpose within the meaning of this Section, provided the home rule unit agrees

Illinois Supreme Court, which licenses persons to engage in any occupation,
information that a person licensed by such agency has failed to file
returns or reports under this Act or pay the tax, penalty and interest shown therein,
or has failed to pay any final assessment of tax, penalty or interest due
under this Act.  An assessment is final when all proceedings in court for
review of such assessment have terminated or the time for the taking
thereof has expired without such proceedings being instituted. The Director shall make available for public
inspection in the Department's principal office and for publication, at cost,
administrative decisions issued on or after January
1, 1995. These decisions are to be made available in a manner so that the
following
taxpayer or licensee information is not disclosed: (1) The names, addresses, and identification numbers of the taxpayer or licensee, related entities, and employees. (2) At the sole discretion of the Director, trade secrets or other confidential information identified as such by the taxpayer or licensee, no later than 30 days after receipt of an administrative decision, by such means as the Department shall provide by rule.

reasonable rules and regulations relating
to the administration and
enforcement of this Act as may be deemed expedient</heading>
            <content>
              <p>Whenever notice is required by this Act, such notice may be given by
United States certified or registered mail, addressed to the person concerned
at his or her
last known address, and proof of such mailing shall be sufficient for the
purposes of this Act.  Notice of any hearing provided for by this Act and held before the Department shall
be so given not less than 7 days prior to the day fixed for the hearing. Hearings provided for in this Act, other than hearings before the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal, shall be held: (1) In Cook County, if the taxpayer's or licensee's principal place of business is in that county; (2) At the Department's office nearest the taxpayer's or licensee's principal place of business, if the taxpayer's or licensee's principal place of business is in Illinois but outside Cook County; (3) In Sangamon County, if the taxpayer's or licensee's principal place of business is outside Illinois. The Circuit Court of the County wherein the hearing is held shall have
power to review all final administrative decisions of the Department in
administering this Act.  The provisions of the Administrative Review Law,
as amended, and the
rules adopted pursuant thereto, shall apply to and govern all proceedings
for the judicial review of final administrative decisions of the Department
under this Act.
The term &quot;administrative decision&quot; is defined as in Section 3-101 of the
Code of Civil Procedure. Service upon the Director of Revenue or Assistant Director of Revenue of
the Department of Revenue of summons issued in any action to review a final
administrative decision shall be service upon the Department.  The
Department shall certify the record of its proceedings if the plaintiff
in the action for judicial review shall pay to it the sum of
75¢ per page of
testimony taken before the Department and 25¢ per page of all other matters
contained in such record, except that these charges may be waived where the
Department is satisfied that the aggrieved party is a poor person who
cannot afford to pay such charges.   However, before the delivery
of such record to the person applying for it payment of these charges must
be made, and if the record is not paid for within 30 days after notice that
such record is available, the
complaint may be dismissed by the court upon motion of the Department. No stay order shall be entered by the Circuit Court unless the plaintiff
in the action for judicial review files with the court a
bond in an amount fixed and approved by the court, to indemnify the State
against all loss and injury which may be sustained by it on account of the
review proceedings and to secure all costs which may be occasioned by such
proceedings. Whenever any proceeding provided by this Act is commenced before the
Department, either by the Department or by a person subject to this Act,
and such person thereafter dies or becomes a person under legal disability
before such
proceeding is concluded, the legal representative of the deceased or a
person under legal disability shall notify the Department of such death or legal
disability.  Such legal representative, as such, shall
then be substituted
by the Department for such person.  If the legal representative fails to
notify the Department of his  or her appointment as such legal representative, the
Department may, upon its own motion, substitute such legal representative
in the proceeding pending before the Department for the person who died or
became a person under legal disability. Hearings to protest an administrative decision of the Department conducted as a result of a protest filed with the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal on or after July 1, 2013 shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal Act of 2012.</p>
