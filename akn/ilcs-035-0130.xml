            <content>
              <p>Payment of
the taxes imposed by Section 2 of this Act shall
(except as hereinafter provided) be evidenced by revenue tax stamps affixed
to each original package of cigarettes. Each distributor of cigarettes,
before delivering or causing to be delivered any original package of
cigarettes in this State to a purchaser, shall firmly affix a proper stamp
or stamps to each such package, or (in case of manufacturers of cigarettes
in original packages which are contained inside a sealed transparent
wrapper) shall imprint the required language on the original package of
cigarettes beneath such outside wrapper, as hereinafter provided. No stamp or imprint may be affixed to, or made upon, any package of
cigarettes unless that package complies with all requirements of the federal
Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 U.S.C. 1331 and following, for the
placement of labels, warnings, or any other information upon a package of
cigarettes that is sold within the United States.  Under the authority of
Section 6, the Department shall revoke the license of any distributor that is
determined to have violated this paragraph.
A person may not affix a stamp on a package of cigarettes, cigarette papers,
wrappers, or tubes if that individual package has been marked for export
outside the United States with a label or notice in compliance with Section
290.185 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  It is not a defense to
a proceeding for violation of this paragraph that the label or notice has been
removed, mutilated, obliterated, or altered in any manner. Only distributors licensed under this Act and transporters, as defined in Section 9c of this Act, may possess unstamped original packages of cigarettes.  Prior to shipment to a secondary distributor or an Illinois retailer, a stamp shall be applied to each original package of cigarettes sold to the secondary distributor or retailer. A distributor may apply tax stamps only to original packages of cigarettes purchased or obtained directly from an in-state maker, manufacturer, or fabricator licensed as a distributor under Section 4 of this Act or an out-of-state maker, manufacturer, or fabricator holding a permit under Section 4b of this Act.  A licensed distributor may ship or otherwise cause to be delivered unstamped original packages of cigarettes in, into, or from this State. A licensed distributor may transport unstamped original packages of cigarettes to a facility, wherever located, owned or controlled by such distributor; however, a distributor may not transport unstamped original packages of cigarettes to a facility where retail sales of cigarettes take place or to a facility where a secondary distributor makes sales for resale.  Any licensed distributor that ships or otherwise causes to be delivered unstamped original packages of cigarettes into, within, or from this State shall ensure that the invoice or equivalent documentation and the bill of lading or freight bill for the shipment identifies the true name and address of the consignor or seller, the true name and address of the consignee or purchaser, and the quantity by brand style of the cigarettes so transported, provided that this Section shall not be construed as to impose any requirement or liability upon any common or contract carrier. The Department, or any person authorized by the Department, shall
sell such stamps only to persons holding valid
licenses as distributors under this Act.  On and after July 1, 2003, payment
for such stamps must be made by means of
electronic funds transfer.  The Department may refuse to sell stamps to any
person who does not comply
with the provisions of this Act.
Beginning on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 92nd General
Assembly and through June 30, 2002, persons holding valid licenses as
distributors
may purchase cigarette tax stamps up to an amount equal to 115% of the
distributor's average monthly cigarette tax stamp purchases over the 12
calendar
months prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 92nd General
Assembly. Prior to December 1, 1985, the Department shall allow a distributor
21 days in which to make final
payment of the amount to be paid for such stamps, by allowing the
distributor to make payment for the stamps at the time of purchasing them
with a draft which shall be in such form as the Department prescribes, and
which shall be payable within 21 days thereafter: Provided that such
distributor has filed with the Department, and has received the
Department's approval of, a bond, which is in addition to the bond required
under Section 4 of this Act, payable to the Department in an amount equal
to 80% of such distributor's average monthly tax liability to
the Department under this Act during the preceding calendar year or $500,000,
whichever is less. The Bond shall be joint and
several and shall be in the form of a surety company bond in such form as
the Department prescribes, or it may be in the form of a bank certificate
of deposit or bank letter of credit. The bond shall be conditioned upon the
distributor's payment of amount of any 21-day draft which the Department
accepts from that distributor for the delivery of stamps to that
distributor under this Act. The distributor's failure to pay any such
draft, when due, shall also make such distributor automatically liable to
the Department for a penalty equal to 25% of the amount of such draft. On and after December 1, 1985 and until July 1, 2003, the Department
shall allow a distributor
30 days in which to make
final payment of the amount to be paid for such stamps, by allowing the
distributor to make payment for the stamps at the time of purchasing them
with a draft which shall be in such form as the Department prescribes, and
which shall be payable within 30 days thereafter, and beginning on January 1,
2003 and thereafter, the draft shall be payable by means of electronic funds
transfer:  Provided that such
distributor has filed with the Department, and has received the
Department's approval of, a bond, which is in addition to the bond required
under Section 4 of this Act, payable to the Department in an amount equal
to 150% of such distributor's average monthly tax liability to the
Department under this Act during the preceding calendar year or $750,000,
whichever is less, except that as to bonds filed on or after January 1,
1987, such additional bond shall be in an amount equal to 100% of such
distributor's average monthly tax liability under this Act during the
preceding calendar year or $750,000, whichever is less.  The bond shall be
joint and several and shall be in the form of a surety company bond in such
form as the Department prescribes, or it may be in the form of a bank
certificate of deposit or bank letter of credit.
The bond shall be conditioned upon the distributor's payment of the amount
of any 30-day draft which the Department accepts from that distributor for
the delivery of stamps to that distributor under this Act.  The
distributor's failure to pay any such draft, when due, shall also make such
distributor automatically liable to the Department for a penalty equal to
25% of the amount of such draft. Every prior continuous compliance taxpayer shall be exempt from all
requirements under this Section concerning the furnishing of such bond, as
defined in this Section, as a condition precedent to his being authorized
to engage in the business licensed under this Act.  This exemption shall
continue for each such taxpayer until such time as he may be determined by
the Department to be delinquent in the filing of any returns, or is
determined by the Department (either through the Department's issuance of a
final assessment which has become final under the Act, or by the taxpayer's
filing of a return which admits tax to be due that is not paid) to be
delinquent or deficient in the paying of any tax under this Act, a</p>

                <p>Such other additional information as the Department may lawfully require by its rules and regulations. The annual license fee payable to the Department for each distributor's
license shall be $250. The purpose of such annual license fee is to defray
the cost, to the Department, of
serializing cigarette tax stamps. Each applicant for license shall pay such
fee to the Department at the time of submitting his application for license
to the Department. Every applicant who is required to procure a distributor's license shall
file with his application a joint and several bond. Such bond shall be
executed to the Department of Revenue, with good and sufficient surety or
sureties residing or licensed to do business within the State of Illinois,
in the amount of $2,500, conditioned upon the true and faithful compliance
by the licensee with all of the provisions of this Act. Such bond, or a
reissue thereof, or a substitute therefor, shall be kept in effect during
the entire period covered by the license. A separate application for
license shall be made, a separate annual license fee paid, and a separate
bond filed, for each place of business at which a person who is required to
procure a distributor's license under this Section proposes to engage in
business as a distributor in Illinois under this Act. The following are ineligible to receive a distributor's license under

license under this Act, shall issue to such applicant a license in form as
prescribed by the Department, which license shall permit the applicant to
which it is issued to engage in business as a distributor at the place
shown in his application. All licenses issued by the Department under this
Act shall be valid for not to exceed one year after issuance unless sooner
revoked, canceled or suspended as provided in this Act. No license issued
under this Act is transferable or assignable. Such license shall be
conspicuously displayed in the place of business conducted by the licensee
in Illinois under such license. No distributor licensee acquires any vested interest or compensable property right in a license issued under this Act. A licensed distributor shall notify the Department of any change in the information contained on the application form, including any change in ownership and shall do so within 30 days after any such change. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Department under this Section
may, within 20 days after notice of the decision, protest and request a
hearing.  Upon receiving a request for a hearing, the Department shall give
notice to the person requesting the hearing of the time and place fixed for the

and then issue its final administrative decision in the matter to that person.
In the absence of a protest and request for a hearing within 20 days, the

being made or notice given.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Beginning on January 1, 2016, no person may engage in business as a retailer of cigarettes in this State without first having obtained a license from the Department. Application for license shall be made to the Department, by electronic means, in  a form  prescribed by the Department. Each applicant for a license under this Section shall furnish to the Department, in an electronic format established by the Department, the following information: (1) the name and address of the applicant; (2) the address of the location at which the applicant proposes to engage in business as a retailer of cigarettes in this State; and (3) such other additional information as the Department may lawfully require by its rules and regulations. The annual license fee payable to the Department for each retailer's license shall be $75.  The fee shall be deposited into the Tax Compliance and Administration Fund and shall be for the cost of tobacco retail inspection and contraband tobacco and tobacco smuggling with at least two-thirds of the money being used for contraband tobacco and tobacco smuggling operations and enforcement. Each applicant for a license shall pay the fee to the Department at the time of submitting its application for a license to the Department. The Department shall require an applicant for a license under this Section to electronically file and pay the fee. A separate annual license fee shall be paid for each place of business at which a person who is required to procure a retailer's license under this Section proposes to engage in business as a retailer in Illinois under this Act. The following are ineligible to receive a retailer's license under this Act: (1) a person who has been convicted of a felony related to the illegal transportation, sale, or distribution of cigarettes, or a tobacco-related felony, under any federal or State law, if the Department, after investigation and a hearing if requested by the applicant, determines that the person has not been sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant the public trust; or (2) a corporation, if any officer, manager, or director thereof, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate more than 5% of the stock of such corporation, would not be eligible to receive a license under this Act for any reason. The Department, upon receipt of an application and license fee, in proper form, from a person who is eligible to receive a retailer's license under this Act, shall issue to such applicant a license in form as prescribed by the Department.  That license shall permit the applicant to whom it is issued to engage in business as a retailer under this Act at the place shown in his or her application. All licenses issued by the Department under this Section shall be valid for a period not to exceed one year after issuance unless sooner revoked, canceled, or suspended as provided in this Act. No license issued under this Section is transferable or assignable. The license shall be conspicuously displayed in the place of business conducted by the licensee in Illinois under such license. The Department shall not issue a retailer's license to a retailer unless the retailer is also registered under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. A person who obtains a license as a retailer who ceases to do business as specified in the license, or who never commenced business, or whose license is suspended or revoked, shall immediately surrender the license to the Department. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Department under this Section may, within 30 days after notice of the decision, protest and request a hearing. Upon receiving a request for a hearing, the Department shall give written notice to the person requesting the hearing of the time and place fixed for the hearing and shall hold a hearing in conformity with the provisions of this Act and then issue its final administrative decision in the matter to that person. In the absence of a protest and request for a hearing within 30 days, the Department's decision shall become final without any further determination being made or notice given.</p>

            <heading>The Department or any officer or employee of the Department
designated, in writing, by the Director thereof, shall at its or his or
her own instance, or on the written request of any distributor, secondary distributor, retailer, manufacturer with authority to maintain manufacturer representatives, or other interested
party to the proceeding, issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of and
the giving of testimony by witnesses, and subpoenas duces tecum requiring
the production of books, papers, records or memoranda</heading>
            <content>
              <p>All subpoenas and
subpoenas duces tecum issued under the terms of this Act may be served by
any person of full age. The fees of witnesses for attendance and travel
shall be the same as the fees of witnesses before the circuit court of this
State; such fees to be paid when the witness is excused from further
attendance. When the witness is subpoenaed at the instance of the
Department or any officer or employee thereof, such fees shall be paid in
the same manner as other expenses of the Department, and when the witness
is subpoenaed at the instance of any other party to any such proceeding,
the cost of service of the subpoena or subpoena duces tecum and the fee of
the witness shall be borne by the party at whose instance the witness is
summoned. In such case the Department, in its discretion, may require a
deposit to cover the cost of such service and witness fees. A subpoena or
subpoena duces tecum so issued shall be served in the same manner as a subpoena
or subpoena duces tecum issued out of a court. Any circuit court of this State, upon the
application of the Department or any officer or employee thereof, or upon
the application of any other party to the proceeding, may, in its
discretion, compel the attendance of witnesses, the production of books,
papers, records or memoranda and the giving of testimony before the
Department or any officer or employee thereof conducting an investigation
or holding a hearing authorized by this Act, by an attachment for contempt,
or otherwise, in the same manner as production of evidence may be compelled
before the court. The Department or any officer or employee thereof, or any other party in
an investigation or hearing before the Department, may cause the
depositions of witnesses within the State to be taken in the manner
prescribed by law for like depositions, or depositions for discovery in
civil actions in courts of this State, and to that end compel the
attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, records or
memoranda, in the same manner hereinbefore provided.</p>

            <heading>The Department may make, promulgate and enforce such
reasonable rules and regulations relating to the administration and
enforcement of this Act as may be deemed expedient</heading>
            <content>
              <p>Whenever notice is required by this Act, such notice may be given by
United States certified or registered mail, addressed to the person concerned at his
last known address, and proof of such mailing shall be sufficient for the
purposes of this Act.  Notice of any hearing provided for by this Act and held before the Department shall
be so given not less than 7 days prior to the day fixed for the hearing. Hearings provided for in this Act, other than hearings before the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal, shall be held: (1) In Cook County, if the taxpayer's or licensee's principal place of business is in that county; (2) At the Department's office nearest the taxpayer's or licensee's principal place of business, if the taxpayer's or licensee's principal place of business is in Illinois but outside Cook County; (3) In Sangamon County, if the taxpayer's or licensee's principal place of business is outside Illinois. The Circuit Court of the County wherein the hearing is held has
power to review all final administrative decisions of the Department in
administering this Act.  The provisions of the Administrative Review Law,
and all amendments and
modifications thereof, and the rules adopted pursuant thereto, shall
apply to and govern all proceedings for the judicial review of final
administrative decisions of the Department under this Act.  The term
&quot;administrative decision&quot; is defined as in Section 3-101 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Service upon the Director of Revenue or Assistant Director of Revenue
of summons issued in any action to review a final
administrative decision shall be service upon the Department.  The
Department shall certify the record of its proceedings if the distributor, secondary distributor, retailer, or manufacturer with authority to maintain manufacturer representatives pays to it the sum of 75¢ per page of testimony taken before the Department
and 25¢ per page of all other matters contained in such record, except that
these charges may be waived where the Department is satisfied that the aggrieved
party is a poor person who cannot afford to pay such charges.
Before the delivery of such record to the person applying for it, payment
of these charges must be made, and if
the record is not paid for within 30 days after notice that such record
is available, the
complaint may be dismissed by the court upon motion of the Department. No stay order shall be entered by the Circuit Court unless the
distributor, secondary distributor, retailer, or manufacturer with authority to maintain manufacturer representatives files with the court a bond in an amount fixed and approved by
the court, to indemnify the State against all loss and injury which may be
sustained by it on account of the review proceedings and to secure all
costs which may be occasioned by such proceedings. Whenever any proceeding provided by this Act is begun before the
Department, either by the Department or by a person subject to this Act,
and such person thereafter dies or becomes a person under legal disability
before such
proceeding is concluded, the legal representative of the deceased person
or of the person under legal disability shall notify
the Department of such death or legal disability.
Such legal representative, as such, shall then be substituted
by the Department for such person.  If the legal representative fails to
notify the Department of his or her appointment as such legal representative, the
Department may, upon its own motion, substitute such legal representative
in the proceeding pending before the Department for the person who died or
became a person under legal disability. Hearings to contest an administrative decision under this Act conducted as a result of a protest filed with the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal on or after July 1, 2013 shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal Act of 2012.</p>

              <p>Every distributor who is required to procure a license under this Act, but who is not a manufacturer of cigarettes in original packages which are contained in a sealed transparent wrapper, shall, on or before the 15th day of each calendar month, file a return with the Department, showing the quantity of cigarettes manufactured during the preceding calendar month, the quantity of cigarettes brought into this State or caused to be brought into this State from outside this State during the preceding calendar month without authorized evidence on the original packages of such cigarettes underneath the sealed transparent wrapper thereof that the tax liability imposed by this Act has been assumed by the out-of-State seller of such cigarettes, the quantity of cigarettes purchased tax-paid during the preceding calendar month either within or outside this State, the quantity of cigarettes sold by manufacturer representatives on behalf of the distributor, the quantity of cigarettes sold to manufacturer representatives, and the quantity of cigarettes sold or otherwise disposed of during the preceding calendar month. Such return shall be filed upon forms furnished and prescribed by the Department and shall contain such other information as the Department may reasonably require. Information that the Department may reasonably require includes information related to the uniform regulation and taxation of cigarettes. The Department may promulgate rules to require that the distributor's return be accompanied by appropriate computer-generated magnetic media supporting schedule data in the format required by the Department, unless, as provided by rule, the Department grants an exception upon petition of a distributor. Illinois manufacturers of cigarettes in original packages which are contained inside a sealed transparent wrapper shall file a return by the 5th day of each month covering the preceding calendar month. Each such return shall be accompanied by the appropriate remittance for tax as provided in Section 3 of this Act. Each such return shall show the quantity of such cigarettes manufactured during the period covered by the return, the quantity of cigarettes sold or otherwise disposed of during the period covered by the return and such other information as the Department may lawfully require. Information that the Department may lawfully require includes information related to the uniform regulation and taxation of cigarettes. Such returns shall be filed on forms prescribed and furnished by the Department. Each such return shall be accompanied by a copy of each invoice rendered by such manufacturer to any purchaser to whom such manufacturer delivered cigarettes (or caused cigarettes to be delivered) during the period covered by the return. The Department may promulgate rules to require that the manufacturer's return be accompanied by appropriate computer-generated magnetic media supporting schedule data in the format required by the Department, unless, as provided by rule, the Department grants an exception upon petition of a manufacturer.</p>

              <p>Every distributor who is required to procure a license under this Act, but who is not a manufacturer of cigarettes in original packages which are contained in a sealed transparent wrapper, shall, on or before the 15th day of each calendar month, file a return with the Department, showing the quantity of cigarettes manufactured during the preceding calendar month, the quantity of cigarettes brought into this State or caused to be brought into this State from outside this State during the preceding calendar month without authorized evidence on the original packages of such cigarettes underneath the sealed transparent wrapper thereof that the tax liability imposed by this Act has been assumed by the out-of-State seller of such cigarettes, the quantity of cigarettes purchased tax-paid during the preceding calendar month either within or outside this State, the quantity of cigarettes sold by manufacturer representatives on behalf of the distributor, the quantity of cigarettes sold to manufacturer representatives, and the quantity of cigarettes sold or otherwise disposed of during the preceding calendar month.

            <heading>Examination and correction of returns</heading>
            <content>
              <p>(1) As soon as practicable after any return is filed, the
Department shall examine such return and shall correct such return
according to its best judgment and information, which return so corrected
by the Department shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie
evidence of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown therein.
Instead of requiring the distributor to file an amended return, the
Department may simply notify the distributor of the correction or
corrections it has made. Proof of such correction by the Department may be
made at any hearing before the Department or in any legal proceeding by a
reproduced copy of the Department's record relating thereto in the name of
the Department under the certificate of the Director of Revenue. Such
reproduced copy shall, without further proof, be admitted into evidence
before the Department or in any legal proceeding and shall be prima facie
proof of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown therein. If the
Department finds that any amount of tax is due from the distributor, the
Department shall issue the distributor a notice of tax liability for the
amount of tax claimed by the Department to be due, together with a penalty
in an amount determined in accordance with Sections 3-3, 3-5 and 3-6 of the
Uniform Penalty and Interest Act. If, in administering the provisions of
this Act, comparison of a return or returns of a distributor with the
books, records and inventories of such distributor discloses a deficiency
which cannot be allocated by the Department to a particular month or
months, the Department shall issue the distributor a notice of tax
liability for the amount of tax claimed by the Department to be due for a
given period, but without any obligation upon the Department to allocate
such deficiency to any particular month or months, together with a penalty
in an amount determined in accordance with Sections 3-3, 3-5 and 3-6 of the
Uniform Penalty and Interest Act, under which circumstances the aforesaid
notice of tax liability shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima
facie evidence of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown
therein; and proof of such correctness may be made in accordance with, and
the admissibility of a reproduced copy of such notice of tax liability
shall be governed by, all the provisions of this Act applicable to
corrected returns. If any distributor filing any return dies or becomes a
person under legal disability at any time before the Department issues its
notice of tax liability, such notice shall be issued to the administrator,
executor or other legal representative, as such, of such distributor. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this Section, if, within 60 days after such notice of tax liability, the
distributor or his or her legal representative files a protest to such
notice of tax liability and requests a hearing thereon, the Department shall
give notice to such distributor or legal representative of the time and place
fixed for such hearing, and shall hold a hearing in conformity with the
provisions of this Act, and pursuant thereto shall issue a final assessment
to such distributor or legal representative for the amount found to be due
as a result of such hearing. On or after July 1, 2013, protests concerning matters that are subject to the jurisdiction of the  Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal shall be filed in accordance with the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal Act of 2012, and hearings concerning those matters shall be held before the Tribunal in accordance with that Act.  With respect to protests filed with the Department prior to July 1, 2013 that would otherwise be subject to the jurisdiction of the  Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal, the taxpayer may elect to be subject to the provisions of the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal Act of 2012 at any time on or after July 1, 2013, but not later than 30 days after the date on which the protest was filed.  If made, the election shall be irrevocable. If a protest to the notice of tax liability
and a request for a hearing thereon is not filed within the time allowed by law, such notice of tax liability shall become final
without the necessity of a final assessment being issued and shall be
deemed to be a final assessment. (3) In case of failure to pay the tax, or any portion thereof, or any
penalty provided for in this Act, when due, the Department may bring suit
to recover the amount of such tax, or portion thereof, or penalty; or, if
the taxpayer dies or becomes incompetent, by filing claim therefor against
his estate; provided that no such action with respect to any tax, or portion
thereof, or penalty, shall be instituted more than 2 years after the cause
of action accrues, except with the consent of the person from whom such tax
or penalty is due. After the expiration of the period within which the person assessed may
file an action for judicial review under the Administrative Review Law
without such an action being filed, a certified copy of the final assessment
or revised final assessment of the Department may be filed with the Circuit
Court of the county in which the taxpayer has his or her principal place of
business, or of Sangamon County in those cases in which the taxpayer does
not have his principal place of business in this State. The certified copy
of the final assessment or revised final assessment shall be accompanied by
a certification which recites facts that are sufficient to show that the
Department complied with the jurisdictional requirements of the Law in
arriving at its final assessment or its revised final assessment and that
the taxpayer had his or her opportunity for an administrative hearing and for
judicial review, whether he availed himself or herself of either or both of
these opportunities or not. If the court is satisfied that the Department
complied with the jurisdictional requirements of the Law in arriving at its
final assessment or its revised final assessment and that the taxpayer had
his or her opportunity for an administrative hearing and for judicial review,
whether he or she availed himself or herself of either or both of
these opportunities or not, the court shall enter judgment in favor of the
Department and against the taxpayer for the amount shown to be due by the
final assessment or the revised final assessment, and such judgment shall
be filed of record in the court.  Such judgment shall bear the rate of
interest set in the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act, but otherwise shall
have the same effect as other judgments.  The judgment may be enforced, and
all laws applicable to sales for the enforcement of a judgment shall be
applicable to sales made under such judgments. The Department shall file
the certified copy of its assessment, as herein provided, with the Circuit
Court within 2 years after such assessment becomes final except when the
taxpayer consents in writing to an extension of such filing period. If, when the cause of action for a proceeding in court accrues against a
person, he or she is out of the State, the action may be commenced within the
times herein limited, after his or her coming into or return to the State;
and if, after the cause of action accrues, he or she departs from and
remains out of the State, the time of his or her absence is no part of the
time limited for the commencement of the action; but the foregoing
provisions concerning absence from the State shall not apply to any case in
which, at the time the cause of action accrues, the party against whom the
cause of action accrues is not a resident of this State. The time within
which a court action is to be commenced by the Department hereunder shall
not run while the taxpayer is a debtor in any proceeding under the Federal
Bankruptcy Act nor thereafter until 90 days after the Department is
notified by such debtor of being discharged in bankruptcy. No clai</p>

              <p>In case any person
who is required to file a return under this Act
fails to file such return, the Department shall determine the amount of tax
due from him according to its best judgment and information, which amount
so fixed by the Department shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima
facie evidence of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown in
such determination. Proof of such determination by the Department may be
made at any hearing before the Department or in any legal proceeding by a
reproduced copy of the Department's record relating thereto in the name of
the Department under the certificate of the Director of Revenue. Such
reproduced copy shall, without further proof, be admitted into evidence
before the Department or in any legal proceeding and shall be prima facie
proof of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown therein. The
Department shall issue such person a notice of tax liability for the amount
of tax claimed by the Department to be due, together with a penalty in
an amount determined in accordance with Sections 3-3, 3-5 and 3-6 of the
Uniform Penalty and Interest Act. If such person or the legal representative of
such person, within 60 days after such notice, files a protest to
such
notice of tax liability and requests a hearing thereon, the Department
shall give notice to such person or the legal representative of such person
of the time and place fixed for such hearing and shall hold a hearing in
conformity with the provisions of this Act, and pursuant thereto shall
issue a final assessment to such person or to the legal representative of
such person for the amount found to be due as a result of such hearing. Hearings to protest a notice of tax liability issued pursuant to this Section that are conducted as a result of a protest filed with the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal on or after July 1, 2013 shall be conducted pursuant to the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal Act of 2012. If
a protest to the notice of tax liability and a request for a hearing
thereon is not filed within 60 days after such notice of tax
liability,
such notice of tax liability shall become final without the necessity of a
final assessment being issued and shall be deemed to be a final assessment.</p>

            <heading>If it appears, after claim therefor filed with the Department,
that an amount of tax or penalty has been paid which was not due under this
Act, whether as the result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, except as
hereinafter provided, then the Department shall issue a credit memorandum
or refund to the person who made the erroneous payment or, if that person
has died or become a person under legal disability, to his or her legal
representative, as such</heading>
            <content>
              <p>If it is determined that the Department should issue a credit or refund
under this Act, the Department may first apply the amount thereof against
any amount of tax or penalty due under this Act or under the Cigarette Use
Tax Act from the person entitled to such credit or refund. For this
purpose, if proceedings are pending to determine whether or not any tax or
penalty is due under this Act or under the Cigarette Use Tax Act from such
person, the Department may withhold issuance of the credit or refund
pending the final disposition of such proceedings and may apply such credit
or refund against any amount found to be due to the Department under this
Act or under the Cigarette Use Tax Act as a result of such proceedings. The
balance, if any, of the credit or refund shall be issued to the person
entitled thereto. If no tax or penalty is due and no proceeding is pending to determine
whether such taxpayer is indebted to the Department for tax or penalty, the
credit memorandum or refund shall be issued to the claimant; or (in the
case of a credit memorandum) the credit memorandum may be assigned and set
over by the lawful holder thereof, subject to reasonable rules of the
Department, to any other person who is subject to this Act or the Cigarette
Use Tax Act, and the amount thereof shall be applied by the Department
against any tax or penalty due or to become due under this Act or under the
Cigarette Use Tax Act from such assignee. As to any claim filed hereunder with the Department on and after each
January 1 and July 1, no amount of tax or penalty erroneously paid (either
in total or partial liquidation of a tax or penalty under this Act) more
than 3 years prior to such January 1 and July 1, respectively, shall be
credited or refunded, except that if both the Department and the taxpayer
have agreed to an extension of time to issue a notice of tax liability under
this Act, the claim may be filed at any time prior to the expiration of the
period agreed upon. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act to the contrary, for any period included in a claim for credit or refund for which the statute of limitations for issuing a notice of tax liability under this Act will expire less than 6 months after the date a taxpayer files the claim for credit or refund, the statute of limitations is automatically extended for 6 months from the date it would have otherwise expired. If the Department approves a claim for stamps affixed to a product returned
to a manufacturer or for replacement of stamps, the credit memorandum shall not
exceed the face value of stamps originally affixed, and replacement stamps
shall be issued only in an amount equal to the value of the stamps previously
affixed.  Higher denomination stamps shall not be issued as replacements for
lower value stamps.  Distributors must prove the face value of the stamps which
have been destroyed or returned to manufacturers when filing claims. Any credit or refund that is allowed under this Act shall bear interest
at the rate and in the manner set forth in the Uniform Penalty and Interest
Act. In case the Department determines that the claimant is entitled to a
refund, such refund shall be made only from such appropriation as may be
available for that purpose. If it appears unlikely that the amount
appropriated would permit everyone having a claim allowed during the period
covered by such appropriation to elect to receive a cash refund, the
Department, by rule or regulation, shall provide for the payment of refunds
in hardship cases and shall define what types of cases qualify as hardship
cases. If the Department approves a claim for the physical replacement of
cigarette tax stamps, the Department (subject to the same limitations as
those provided for hereinbefore in this Section) may issue an assignable
credit memorandum or refund to the claimant or to the claimant's legal
representative. The provisions of Sections 6a, 6b and 6c of the Retailers' Occupation
Tax Act which are not inconsistent with this Act, shall apply, as far as
practicable, to the subject matter of this Act to the same extent as if
such provisions were included herein.</p>

              <p>Nothing in this Act prevents the Director of Revenue from publishing
or making available to the public the names and addresses of persons
filing returns or reports under this Act, or reasonable statistics concerning the
operation of the tax by grouping the contents of returns or reports so that the
information in any individual return or report is not disclosed. Nothing in this Act prevents the Director of Revenue from divulging
to the United States Government or the government of any other state, or
any officer or agency thereof, for exclusively official purposes,
information received by the Department in administering this Act,
provided that such other governmental agency agrees to divulge requested
tax information to the Department. The furnishing upon request of the Auditor General, or his authorized
agents, for official use, of returns or reports filed and information related
thereto under this Act is deemed to be an official purpose within the
meaning of this Section. The furnishing of financial information to a home rule unit with a
population in excess of 2,000,000 that has
imposed a tax similar to that imposed by this Act under its home rule powers,
upon request of the Chief Executive of the home rule unit, is an official
purpose within the meaning of this Section, provided the home rule unit agrees
in writing to the requirements of this Section. Information so provided is
subject to all confidentiality provisions of this Section. The written
agreement shall provide for reciprocity, limitations on access, disclosure,
and procedures for requesting information. The Director may make available to any State agency, including the
Illinois Supreme Court, which licenses persons to engage in any occupation,
information that a person licensed by such agency has failed to file
returns under this Act or pay the tax, penalty and interest shown therein,
or has failed to pay any final assessment of tax, penalty or interest due
under this Act or has failed to file reports under this Act.  An assessment is final when all proceedings in court for
review of such assessment have terminated or the time for the taking
thereof has expired without such proceedings being instituted. The Director shall make available for public
inspection in the Department's principal office and for publication, at cost,
administrative decisions issued on or after January
1, 1995. These decisions are to be made available in a manner so that the
following
taxpayer or licensee information is not disclosed: (1) The names, addresses, and identification numbers of the taxpayer or licensee, related entities, and employees. (2) At the sole discretion of the Director, trade secrets or other confidential information identified as such by the taxpayer or licensee, no later than 30 days after receipt of an administrative decision, by such means as the Department shall provide by rule. The Director shall determine the
appropriate extent of the
deletions allowed in paragraph (2). In the event the taxpayer or licensee does not submit
deletions,
the Director shall make only the deletions specified in paragraph (1). The Director shall make available for public inspection and publication an
administrative decision within 180 days after the issuance of the
administrative
decision. The term &quot;administrative decision&quot; has the same meaning as defined in
Section 3-101 of Article III of the Code of Civil Procedure. Costs collected
under this Section shall be paid into the Tax Compliance and Administration
Fund. Nothing contained in this Act shall prevent the Director from divulging
information to any person pursuant to a request or authorization made by the
taxpayer or licensee or by an authorized representative of the taxpayer or licensee.</p>

Such records need not be maintained on the licensed premises, but must be maintained in the State of Illinois; however, if access is available electronically, the records may be maintained out of state. However, all original invoices or copies thereof covering purchases of cigarettes must be retained on the licensed premises for a period of 90 days after such purchase, unless the Department has granted a waiver in response to a written request in cases where records are kept at a central business location within the State of Illinois or in cases where records that are available electronically are maintained out of state.

              <p>Whenever a retailer obtains original packages of cigarettes from an unlicensed in-state or out-of-state distributor or person, a prima facie presumption shall arise that such original packages of cigarettes are contraband and are possessed by such retailer or were possessed by such retailer in violation of the provisions of this Act and subject to the penalties imposed by Sections 18b and 18c of this Act. Invoices or other documents kept in the normal course of business in the possession of a retailer reflecting purchases of original packages of cigarettes from an unlicensed in-state or out-of-state distributor or person or invoices or other documents kept in the normal course of business obtained by the Department from an in-state or out-of-state distributor or person, are sufficient to raise the presumption that such original packages of cigarettes are contraband and are possessed, or were possessed, by such retailer in violation of the provisions of this Act and the retailer is subject to the penalties imposed by Sections 18b and 18c. If a presumption is raised, the Department may, in addition to the penalties imposed by Sections 18b and 18c and any other civil or criminal penalties provided for in this Act, assess tax, penalty, and interest on the original packages of cigarettes.</p>

found, if such person is known. In case of inability to serve such process
upon the owner or the person in possession of the property at the time of
its seizure, as hereinbefore provided, notice of the proceedings before the
court shall be given as required by the statutes of the State governing
cases of Attachment. Upon the return of the process duly served or upon the
posting or publishing of notice made, as hereinabove provided, the court or
jury, if a jury shall be demanded, shall proceed to determine whether or
not such property so seized was held or possessed in violation of this Act,
or whether, if a vending device has been so seized, it contained at the
time of its seizure original packages of contraband cigarettes. In case of a finding that the original packages
seized were contraband cigarettes, or that any vending device so seized contained at
the time of its seizure original packages of contraband cigarettes, judgment shall be entered
confiscating and forfeiting the property to the State and ordering its
delivery to the Department, and in addition thereto, the court shall have

provided, and when such confiscated and forfeited property shall have been
