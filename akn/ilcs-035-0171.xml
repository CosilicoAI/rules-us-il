                <p>A certified service provider is the agent of a seller, with whom the
certified service provider has contracted, for the collection and remittance of
sales and use taxes.  As the seller's agent, the certified service provider is
liable for sales and use tax due each member state on all sales transactions it
processes for the seller except as set out in this Section. A seller that contracts with a certified service provider is not liable to
the State for sales or use tax due on transactions processed by the certified
service provider unless the seller misrepresented the type of items it sells or
committed fraud.  In the absence of probable cause to believe that the seller
has committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation, the seller is not
subject to audit on the transactions processed by the certified service
provider.  A seller is subject to audit for transactions not processed by the
certified service provider.  The member states acting jointly may perform a
system check of the seller and review the seller's procedures to determine if
the certified service provider's system is functioning properly and the extent
to which the seller's transactions are being processed by the certified service
provider.</p>
