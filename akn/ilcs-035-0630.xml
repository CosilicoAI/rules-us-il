Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale.</p>

collect and remit to the Department the tax imposed by this Act</heading>
            <content>
              <p>Any such
retailer shall be liable for the tax whether or not the tax has been collected
by the retailer.  To the extent that a retailer required to collect the tax
imposed by this Act has actually collected that tax, such tax is held in trust
for the benefit of the Department.  Retailers
shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross
charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in this State, when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the Department. Whenever possible, the tax imposed by this
Article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart
from the gross charge for telecommunications.  The tax imposed by this
Article shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the retailer who
provides such taxable services until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable
at law in the same manner as the original charge for such taxable services.</p>

                <p>Types of returns and filing deadlines. If the retailer's average monthly tax billings due to the Department under this Act and the Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act do not exceed $1,000, the Department may authorize the retailer's returns to be filed on a quarter annual basis, with the return for January, February and March of a given year being due by April 30 of such year; with the return for April, May and June of a given year being due by July 31st of such year; with the return for July, August and September of a given year being due by October 31st of such year; and with the return of October, November and December of a given year being due by January 31st of the following year. If the retailer is otherwise required to file a monthly or quarterly return and if the retailer's average monthly tax billings due to the Department under this Act and the Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act do not exceed $400, the Department may authorize the retailer's return to be filed on an annual basis, with the return for a given year being due by January 31st of the following year. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article containing the time within which a retailer may file a return, in the case of any retailer who ceases to engage in a kind of business which makes the retailer responsible for filing returns under this Article, such retailer shall file a final return under this Article with the Department not more than one month after discontinuing such business. In making such return, the retailer shall determine the value of any consideration other than money received by the retailer and he shall include such value in the return. Such determination shall be subject to review and revision by the Department in the manner hereinafter provided for the correction of returns.</p>

                <p>Payment and discount. Each retailer whose average monthly liability to the Department under this Article and the Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act was $25,000 or more during the preceding calendar year, excluding the month of highest liability and the month of lowest liability in such calendar year, and who is not operated by a unit of local government, shall make estimated payments to the Department on or before the 7th, 15th, 22nd and last day of the month during which tax collection liability to the Department is incurred in an amount not less than the lower of either 22.5% of the retailer's actual tax collections for the month or 25% of the retailer's actual tax collections for the same calendar month of the preceding year. The amount of such quarter monthly payments shall be credited against the final liability of the retailer's return for that month. Any outstanding credit, approved by the Department, arising from the retailer's overpayment of its final liability for any month may be applied to reduce the amount of any subsequent quarter monthly payment or credited against the final liability of the retailer's return for any subsequent month. If any quarter monthly payment is not paid at the time or in the amount required by this Section, the retailer shall be liable for penalty and interest on the difference between the minimum amount due as a payment and the amount of such payment actually and timely paid, except insofar as the retailer has previously made payments for that month to the Department in excess of the minimum payments previously due. The retailer making the return herein provided for shall, at the time of making such return, pay to the Department the amount of tax herein imposed, less a discount of 1% which is allowed to reimburse the retailer for the expenses incurred in keeping records, billing the customer, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax, and supplying data to the Department upon request.

            <heading>If it shall appear that an amount of tax or penalty or
interest has been paid in error hereunder to the Department by a taxpayer,
as distinguished from the retailer, whether such amount be paid through a
mistake of fact or an error of law, such taxpayer may file a claim for
credit or refund with the Department</heading>
            <content>
              <p>If it shall appear that an amount of
tax or penalty or interest has been paid in error to the Department
hereunder by a retailer who is required or authorized to collect and remit
the tax imposed by this Article, whether such amount be paid through a mistake
of fact or an error of law, such retailer may file a claim for credit or
refund with the Department, provided that no credit or refund shall be
allowed for any amount paid by any such retailer unless it shall appear
that he bore the burden of such amount and did not shift the burden thereof
to anyone else, or unless it shall appear that he or she or his or her
legal representative has unconditionally repaid such amount to his customer
(1) who bore the burden thereof and has not shifted such burden directly or
indirectly in any manner whatsoever; or (2) who, if he or she shifted such
burden, has repaid unconditionally such amount to his or her own customer;
and (3) who is not entitled to receive any reimbursement therefor from any
other source than from his retailer, nor to be relieved of such burden in
any other manner whatsoever. If it is determined that the Department should issue a credit or refund
under this Article, the Department may first apply the amount thereof against
any amount of tax or penalty or interest due hereunder from the
person entitled to such credit or refund.  For this purpose, if proceedings
are pending to determine whether or not any tax or penalty or interest is
due under this Article from such person, the Department may withhold issuance
of the credit or refund pending the final disposition of such proceedings
and may apply such credit or refund against any amount found to be due to
the Department as a result of such proceedings.  The balance, if any, of
the credit or refund shall be issued to the person entitled thereto. If no tax or penalty or interest is due and no proceeding is pending to
determine whether such person is indebted to the Department for tax or
penalty or interest, the credit memorandum or refund shall be issued to the
claimant; or (in the case of a credit memorandum) the credit memorandum may
be assigned and set over by the lawful holder thereof, subject to
reasonable rules of the Department, to any other person who is subject to
this Article, and the amount thereof shall be applied by the Department against
any tax or penalty or interest due or to become due under this Article from
such  assignee. As to any claim for credit or refund filed with the Department on or after
each January 1 and July 1, no amounts erroneously paid more than three
years prior to such January 1 and July 1, respectively, shall be
credited or refunded, except that if both the Department and the taxpayer
have agreed to an
extension of time to issue a notice of tax liability under this Act, the claim
may be filed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act to the contrary, for any period included in a claim for credit or refund for which the statute of limitations for issuing a notice of tax liability under this Act will expire less than 6 months after the date a taxpayer files the claim for credit or refund, the statute of limitations is automatically extended for 6 months from the date it would have otherwise expired. Claims for credit or refund shall be filed upon forms provided by the
Department.  As soon as practicable after any claim for credit or refund is
filed, the Department shall examine the same and determine the amount of
credit or refund to which the claimant is entitled and shall notify the
claimant of such determination, which amount shall be prima facie correct. A claim for credit or refund shall be considered to have been filed with
the Department on the date upon which it is received by the Department.
Upon receipt of any claim for credit or refund filed under this Article, any
officer or employee of the Department, authorized in writing by the
Director of Revenue to acknowledge receipt of such claims on behalf of the
Department, shall execute on behalf of the Department, and shall deliver or
mail to the claimant or his duly authorized agent, a written receipt,
acknowledging that the claim has been filed with the Department, describing
the claim in sufficient detail to identify it and stating the date upon
which the claim was received by the Department.  Such written receipt shall
be prima facie evidence that the Department received the claim described in
such receipt and shall be prima facie evidence of the date when such claim
was received by the Department.  In the absence of such a written receipt,
the records of the Department as to when the claim was received by the
Department, or as to whether or not the claim was received at all by the
Department, shall be deemed to be prima facie correct upon these questions
in the event of any dispute between the claimant (or his or her legal
representative) and the Department concerning these questions. Any credit or refund that is allowed under this Article shall bear interest
at the rate and in the manner specified in the Uniform Penalty and Interest
Act. In case the Department determines that the claimant is entitled to a
refund, such refund shall be made only from such appropriation as may be
available for that purpose.  If it appears unlikely that the amount
appropriated would permit everyone having a claim allowed during the period
covered by such appropriation to elect to receive a cash refund, the
Department by rule or regulation shall provide for the payment of refunds
in hardship cases and shall define what types of cases qualify as hardship
cases. If a retailer who has failed to pay tax on gross charges for
telecommunications is required by the Department to pay such tax, such
retailer, without filing any formal claim with the Department, shall be
allowed to take credit against such tax liability
to the extent, if any, to which such retailer has paid the
tax to its vendor of the telecommunications which
such retailer purchased and used for resale, and no penalty or interest
shall be charged to such retailer on the amount of such credit.  However,
when such credit is allowed to the retailer by the Department, the vendor
is precluded from refunding any of the tax to the retailer and filing a
claim for credit or refund with respect thereto with the Department.  The
provisions of this Section added by this amendatory Act of 1988 shall be
applied retroactively, regardless of the date of the transaction.</p>

            <content>
              <p>All information received by the
Department from returns
filed under this Article, or from any investigations conducted under this
Article, shall be confidential, except for official purposes, and any person
who
divulges any such information in any manner, except in accordance with a
proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, shall be guilty of a
Class B misdemeanor. Provided, that nothing contained in this Article shall prevent the Director
from publishing or making available to the public the names and addresses
of retailers or taxpayers filing returns under this Article, or from publishing
or making available reasonable statistics concerning the operation of the
tax wherein the contents of returns are grouped into aggregates in such a
way that the information contained in any individual return shall not be
disclosed. And provided, that nothing contained in this Article shall prevent the
Director from making available to the United States Government or the
government of any other state, or any officer or agency thereof, for
exclusively official purposes, information received by the Department in
the administration of this Article, if such other governmental agency agrees to
divulge requested tax information to the Department. The furnishing upon request of the Auditor General, or his authorized
agents, for official use, of returns filed and information related thereto
under this Article is deemed to be an official purpose within the meaning of
this Section. The furnishing of financial information to a municipality that has imposed
a tax under the Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act, upon request
of the
chief executive thereof, is an official purpose within the meaning of this
Section, provided that the municipality agrees in writing to the requirements
of this Section.  Information so provided shall be subject to all
confidentiality provisions of this Section.  The written agreement shall
provide for reciprocity, limitations on access, disclosure, and procedures for
requesting information. The Director shall make available for public
inspection in the Department's principal office and for publication, at cost,
administrative decisions issued on or after January
1, 1995. These decisions are to be made available in a manner so that the
following
taxpayer information is not disclosed: (1) The names, addresses, and identification numbers of the taxpayer, related entities, and employees. (2) At the sole discretion of the Director, trade secrets or other confidential information identified as such by the taxpayer, no later than 30 days after receipt of an administrative decision, by such means as the Department shall provide by rule. The Director shall determine the
appropriate extent of the
deletions allowed in paragraph (2). In the event the taxpayer does not submit
deletions,
the Director shall make only the deletions specified in paragraph (1). The Director shall make available for public inspection and publication an
administrative decision within 180 days after the issuance of the
administrative
decision. The term &quot;administrative decision&quot; has the same meaning as defined in
Section 3-101 of Article III of the Code of Civil Procedure. Costs collected
under this Section shall be paid into the Tax Compliance and Administration
Fund. Nothing contained in this Act shall prevent the Director from divulging
information to any person pursuant to a request or authorization made by the
taxpayer or by an authorized representative of the taxpayer.</p>

            <heading>Except as otherwise provided in this Section with respect to the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal, the circuit court of any county wherein a hearing is held
shall have power to review all final administrative decisions of the
Department in administering the provision of this Article:  Provided that if
the administrative proceeding which is to be reviewed judicially is a claim
for refund proceeding commenced under this Article and Section 2a of &quot;An Act in
relation to the payment and disposition of moneys received by officers and
employees of the State of Illinois by virtue of their office or
employment&quot;, approved June 9, 1911, as amended, the circuit court having
jurisdiction of the action for judicial review under this Section and under
the Administrative Review Law shall be the same court that entered the
temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction which is provided for
in Section 2a of &quot;An Act in relation to the payment and disposition of
moneys received by officers and employees of the State of Illinois by
virtue of their office or employment&quot;, and which enables such claim
proceeding to be processed and disposed of as a claim for refund proceeding
rather than as a claim for credit proceeding</heading>

              <p>Except as otherwise provided in this Section with respect to the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal, the provisions of the Administrative Review Law, and the rules adopted
pursuant thereto, shall apply to and govern all proceedings for the
judicial review of final administrative decisions of the Department
hereunder.  The term &quot;administrative decision&quot; is defined as in Section
3-101 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The provisions of the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal Act of 2012, and the rules adopted
pursuant thereto, shall apply to and govern all proceedings for the
judicial review of final administrative decisions of the Department that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal. Service upon the Director or Assistant Director of the Department of
Revenue of summons issued in any action to review a final administrative
decision shall be service upon the Department.  The Department shall certify
the record of its proceedings if the taxpayer shall pay to it the sum of
75¢ per page of testimony taken before the Department  and 25¢ per page of
all other matters contained in such record, except that these charges may
be waived where the Department is satisfied that the aggrieved party is a
poor person who cannot afford to pay such charges.</p>

reasonable rules and regulations relating to the administration and
enforcement of this Article as may be deemed expedient</heading>
            <content>
              <p>Any informal rulings, opinions or letters issued by the Department in
response to any inquiry or request for any opinion from any person
regarding the coverage and applicability of this Article shall be maintained as
a public record, and made available for public inspection and copying.  If
the informal ruling, opinion or letter contains trade secrets or other
confidential information, where possible the Department shall delete such
information prior to publication.  Whenever such informal rulings,
opinions or letters contain any policy of general applicability, the
Department shall formulate and adopt such policy as a rule in accordance
with the provisions of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act. Whenever notice to a retailer or taxpayer is required by this Article, such
notice may be personally served or given by United States certified or
registered mail, addressed to the retailer or taxpayer concerned at his
last known address, and proof of such mailing shall be sufficient for the
purposes of this Article.  In the case of a notice of hearing, such notice
shall be mailed not less than 7 days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. All hearings provided for in this Article with respect to a retailer or
taxpayer having his principal place of business in any of the several
counties of this State shall be held in the county wherein the retailer or
taxpayer has his principal place of business.  If the retailer or taxpayer
does not have his principal place of business in this State, such hearings
shall be held in Sangamon County. Whenever any proceeding provided by this Article has been begun by the
Department or by a person subject thereto and such person thereafter dies
or becomes a person under legal disability before the proceeding has been
concluded, the legal representative of the deceased person or a person
under legal disability shall notify the Department of such death or legal
disability.  The legal representative, as such, shall then be substituted
by the Department in place of and for the person.  Within 20 days after
notice to the legal representative of the time fixed for that purpose, the
proceeding may proceed in all respects and with like effect as though the
person had not died or become a person under legal disability.</p>
